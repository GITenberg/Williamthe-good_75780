WILLIAM—THE GOOD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Christmas holidays had arrived at last and
were being celebrated by the Brown family in
various ways.</p>

<p>Ethel and her friends were celebrating it by getting
up a play which was to be acted before the village on
Christmas Eve. Mrs. Brown was celebrating it by
having a whist drive, and William was celebrating it
by having influenza.</p>

<p>Though William is my hero, I will not pretend that
he made a good invalid. On the contrary he made a
very bad one. He possessed none of those virtues of
patience, forbearance, and resignation necessary to a
good invalid. William, suffering from influenza, was
in a state of violent rebellion against fate. And he
was even worse when the virulence of the attack
had waned and he could sit up in bed and partake of
nourishment.</p>

<p>There was, he bitterly complained, nothing to do.</p>

<p>Kind friends brought him in jig-saw puzzles, but,
as he informed those about him incessantly, he didn’t
see what people <i>saw</i> in jig-saw puzzles. He didn’t
like doing them and he didn’t see any good in them
when they were done. As an occupation, they were,
he gave his family to understand, beneath his contempt.
His family offered him other occupations. One of his
aunts kindly sent him a scrap album, and another
kindly sent him a book of general knowledge questions.
He grew more morose and bitter every day. No, he
didn’t want to do any of those things. He wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
get up. Well, why not? Well, to-morrow then?
Well, WHY NOT?</p>

<p>Well, he’d always said that the doctor wasn’t any use.</p>

<p>He’d said so ever since he wouldn’t let him stay in
bed when he felt really ill—that day last term when he
hadn’t done any of his homework. And now, now
that it was holidays, he made him stay in bed. He
simply couldn’t think why they went on having a
man like that for a doctor, a man who simply did everything
he could to annoy people. That was all the
doctoring he knew, doing everything he could to annoy
people. It was a wonder they weren’t all dead with a
doctor like that. No, he didn’t want to do cross-word
puzzles.</p>

<p>What did he want to do then?</p>

<p>He wanted to get up and go out. He wanted to go
and play Red Indians with Ginger and Douglas and
Henry. He wanted to go to the old barn and play
Lions and Tamers. He wanted to go and be an Outlaw
in the woods. That was what he wanted to do. Well,
then, if he couldn’t do anything he wanted to do what
did they keep asking him what he wanted to do for?</p>

<p>In disgust he turned over on his side, took up a book
which a great-aunt had sent him the day before and
began to read it.</p>

<p>Now it was a book which in ordinary circumstances
would not have appealed to William at all. It was a
book in the “Ministering Children” tradition with a
hero as unlike William as could possibly be imagined.
William merely took it up to prove to the whole world
how miserably, unutterably bored he was. But he
read it. And because he was so bored, the story began
to grip him. He read it chapter by chapter, even
receiving his mid-morning cup of beef tea without his
usual execrations.</p>

<p>It was perhaps because of his weakened condition
that the story gripped him. The hero was a boy
about William’s age, whose angelic character made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
him the sunshine of his home. He had a beautiful
sister who, he discovered, was a secret drinker. He
pleaded with her to give up the fatal habit. That was
a very beautiful scene. It had, however, little effect
upon the sister. She became a thief. The youthful hero
saw her steal a valuable piece of old silver in a friend’s
house. At great risk of being himself suspected of the
crime he took it back and replaced it in the friend’s
house. The sister was so deeply touched by this that
she gave up her habits of drink and theft and the story
ended with the youthful hero, his halo gleaming more
brightly than ever, setting out to rescue other criminals
from their lives of crime.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” said William as he closed the book, “an’
only eleven, same as me.”</p>

<p>At once, William ceased to long to play Red Indians
with Ginger and Henry and Douglas. Instead he began
to long to rescue those around him from lives of crime.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Downstairs, Ethel and her mother were talking.
“Have you settled the parts for your play yet, dear?”
said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“N-no,” said Ethel, “it’s all rather annoying. Mrs.
Hawkins has taken up the whole thing, and is managing
everything. Of course, we can’t stop her, because,
after all, she’s going to finance the whole show, and
have footlights put up and make it awfully posh, but
still—she’s insisting on our doing scenes from ‘As You
Like It.’ She <i>would</i> want Shakespeare. She’s so
deadly dull herself.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be Rosalind, I suppose?” said Mrs.
Brown quite placidly.</p>

<p>Ethel was always the heroine of any play she acted in.</p>

<p>But Ethel’s face grew slightly overcast.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “that’s the question. Mrs.
Hawkins is having a sort of trial at her house. It lies
between me and Dolly Morton and Blanche Jones. She
wants to hear us all read the part. She’s going to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
all the committee at her house on Tuesday to hear us all
read the part. It <i>does</i> seem rather silly, doesn’t it? I
mean, making such a fuss about it. However——”</p>

<p>“Well, darling,” said Mrs. Brown, “when you are at
the Hawkins’ I wish you’d ask them if they can let us
have one bon-bon dish. I haven’t quite enough for all
the tables at the whist drive, and Mrs. Hawkins kindly
said she’d lend me as many as I liked.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Ethel absently. “I shall feel <i>mad</i> if
she gives the part to Dolly Morton or Blanche Jones.
I’ve had much more experience and after all——”</p>

<p>After all, Ethel’s silence said, she was far and away
the prettiest girl in the village. She heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown, as if infected with the general melancholy,
also heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>“The doctor says that William can get up to-morrow,”
she said.</p>

<p>Ethel groaned.</p>

<p>“Well,” said her mother wearily, “he <i>can’t</i> be worse
up than he’s been in bed the last few days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>can’t</i> he?” said Ethel meaningly.</p>

<p>“But he’s been quite good this afternoon,” admitted
Mrs. Brown in a voice almost of awe, “reading a book
quietly all the time.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll be awful to-morrow,” prophesied Ethel,
gloomily, and with the suspicion of a nasal intonation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown looked at her suspiciously. “You
haven’t got a cold, have you, Ethel?” she said.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ethel hastily.</p>

<p>“Because if you have,” said Mrs. Brown, “it’s
probably influenza, and you must go to bed the minute
you feel it coming on.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>William was downstairs. He did not, strangely
enough, want to go out and play Red Indians with
Henry, Douglas and Ginger. That lassitude which is
always the after effect of influenza was heavy upon him.
William, however, did not know that this was the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>He mistook it for a change of heart. He believed
his character to be completely altered. He did not
want to be a rough boy ranging over the countryside
any longer. He wanted to be a boy wearing a halo
and rescuing those around him from lives of crime. He
watched Ethel meditatively where she sat on the other
side of the room reading a newspaper. She looked
irritatingly virtuous.</p>

<p>William found it difficult to imagine her drinking
in secret or stealing pieces of silver from a neighbour’s
drawing-room. It was, he reflected, just his luck
to have a sister who was as irritating a sister as could
be, and yet who would afford him no opportunity of
rescuing her from a life of crime. His expression grew
more and more morose as he watched her. There she
sat with no thought in her mind but her silly magazine,
resolutely refusing either to drink or steal.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Ethel had other thoughts in
her mind than the magazine upon which she was
apparently so intent. Ethel was afraid. There was
no doubt at all that a cold was developing in Ethel’s
head, and Ethel knew that, should her mother guess it,
she would be summarily despatched to bed and would
not be able to attend Mrs. Hawkins’ meeting, and that
the result would be that either Dolly Morton or Blanche
Jones would be Rosalind in the play.</p>

<p>Now, Ethel had set her heart upon being Rosalind.
She felt that she would die of shame if Dolly Morton or
Blanche Jones were chosen as Rosalind in her stead.
And, therefore, the peculiar feeling of muzziness, the
difficulty of enunciating certain consonants that she
was at present experiencing, filled her with apprehension.
A cold was coming on. There was no doubt of
it at all. If only it could escape her mother’s notice
till after to-day!</p>

</figure>

<p>After to-day, when she was chosen as Rosalind,
Ethel was willing to retire to bed and stay there as
long as her mother wanted, but not till then. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
she was silent and avoided her mother as much as
possible. She might, of course, take something to
stave it off (though she knew that that was generally
impossible), but her mother had the keys of the
medicine cupboard, and to ask for anything would
arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>The muzziness was growing muzzier every minute,
and she had a horrible suspicion that her nose was red.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered that when William’s cold
began, her mother had bought a bottle of “Cold Cure,”
and given it to him after meals for the first day before
the cold changed to influenza and he had to go to bed.
She believed that it was still in the sideboard cupboard
in the dining-room. She’d sneak it upstairs and take
some. It might just stave it off till to-night.</p>

<p>She looked up and met William’s earnest gaze.
What was he looking at her like that for? He’d
probably noticed that she’d got a cold and he’d go and
tell her mother. It would be just like him. He’d
blurt out, “Mother, Ethel’s got a cold,” and she’d be
packed off to bed and not be able to go to Mrs.
Hawkins’, and Dolly Morton or Blanche Jones would
be Rosalind and she’d die of shame. She stared at
him very haughtily, and then went off to the dining-room
for the bottle of “Cold Cure.”</p>

<p>But her manner had attracted William’s attention.
He moved his seat so that he could see her through
the crack of the door. She went across the hall to the
dining-room. She looked about her furtively. She
tiptoed to the hall again and looked up and down to
make sure that no one saw her. Then very furtively
she went back into the dining-room. She opened the
sideboard cupboard and with a quick guilty movement
took out a bottle and hid it under her jumper. <i>A
bottle!</i> William gaped. His eyes bulged. <i>A bottle!</i>
Still looking furtively around her she went upstairs.
William followed just as furtively. He heard her bolt
her bedroom door. He put his eye to the keyhole and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
there he saw her raise the bottle to her lips. He was
amazed, but he had to believe the evidence of his
eyes. She was a secret drinker. Ethel was a secret
drinker!</p>

<p>His spirits rose. He must set about the work of
reforming her at once. The first thing to do was to
plead with her. That in the book had been a very
moving and beautiful scene.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He was waiting for her in the morning-room when
she came down. Yes, she did look like a secret
drinker now that he came to look at her more particularly.
She’d got a red nose. They always had red
noses. She threw him a haughty glance, took up her
magazine and began to read it. Then suddenly she
was shaken by an enormous sneeze. It came upon her
unawares, before she could stop it. As a matter of
fact, it wasn’t the sort of sneeze you could stop. It
was the sort that proclaimed to all the world that you
have a cold, perhaps influenza, and that you ought to
be in bed.</p>

<p>Thank heaven, thought Ethel, her mother was in the
village shopping. William, however, was gazing at
her reproachfully. He was, she supposed, wondering
bitterly why she was allowed to go about with a cold
when he’d been sent to bed at once. She gazed at him
defiantly. William, as a matter of fact, had not
noticed the sneeze at all. His mind was so taken up
by the problem of how to plead with her to give up
her habit of secret drinking.</p>

<p>He began rather sternly.</p>

<p>“Ethel, I know all about it.”</p>

<p>“Whatever do you mean?” said Ethel feebly, “all
about it! Why, I’m perfectly all right. <i>Perfectly</i> all
right. Anyone can do it once. Once is nothing. It—it’s
<i>good</i> for you to do it once.”</p>

<p>Of course, she’d say that, thought William. In his
book the sister had said that it was the first time——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Have you only done it once, Ethel?” he said
earnestly.</p>

<p>“<i>Of course</i>,” she snapped, “that was the first time.”</p>

<p>She must have known that he’d seen her through
the keyhole. He couldn’t think what to say next.
He’d quite forgotten what the boy in the book had
said, but he remembered suddenly Ethel’s pride in her
personal appearance.</p>

<p>“It’s making you look awful,” he said.</p>

<p>“It <i>isn’t</i>,” snapped Ethel; “my nose <i>is</i> a tiny bit
red, but it’s not due to that at all.”</p>

<p>“I bet it <i>is</i>,” said William.</p>

<p>“It <i>isn’t</i>,” said Ethel. “Anyway”—and she became
almost humble in her pleading—“anyway—you won’t
say anything to mother about it, will you? Promise.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said William.</p>

<p>He promised quite willingly, because he didn’t want
his mother interfering in it any more than Ethel did.
He wanted to have the sole glory of saving Ethel from
her life of crime, and if their mother knew, of course,
she’d take the whole thing out of his hands.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Ethel,” said Mrs. Brown tentatively, “I wonder—I’d
be so much obliged if you’d take William with
you to Mrs. Hawkins’. He’s getting so restless indoors,
and I daren’t let him go out and play, because you
know what he is. He’d be walking in the ditch and
getting his feet wet and getting pneumonia or something.
But if he goes with you it will be a nice little
change for him, and you can keep an eye on him, and—well”—vaguely—“it’ll
be about Shakespeare, and
that’s improving. His last school report was awful.
And, as I say, it will be a nice little change for him.”</p>

<p>Ethel knew that her mother was thinking about a
nice little change for herself, rather than for William,
but, chiefly lest her pronunciation of certain consonants
should betray her, she acquiesced.</p>

<p>“Then I can get on with the preparations for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
whist drive,” said Mrs. Brown, “and you won’t forget
to ask for the bon-bon dish, will you, dear?”</p>

<p>Ethel said “No” (or rather “Do”), and felt grateful
to the whist drive because she knew that it was preoccupation
with it that prevented her mother from
recognising the symptoms of a cold in the head which
were becoming more and more pronounced every minute.</p>

<p>William showed unexpected docility when ordered
to accompany Ethel to Mrs. Hawkins’. He felt that
he had not so far acquitted himself with any conspicuous
success in his rôle of reformer of Ethel. He
could not flatter himself that anything he had said
would have saved her from drink. He might get
another chance during the afternoon.</p>

<p>There was quite a large gathering at Mrs. Hawkins’.
There was Mrs. Hawkins and her daughter Betty.
There was the Committee of the Dramatic Society.
There were Dolly Morton, brought by Mrs. Morton,
and Blanche Jones, brought by Mrs. Jones. They were
first of all given tea by Mrs. Hawkins in the morning-room.
“And then we’ll have our little reading,” she
added.</p>

<p>She accepted William’s presence with resignation
and without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Of course, dear,” she said to Ethel, “I <i>quite</i> understand.
I know they’re trying, especially when they’ve
been ill. Yes, it’s a <i>joy</i> to have him. You’ll be very
quiet, won’t you, my little man, because this is a very
serious occasion. Very serious indeed.”</p>

<p>Ethel sat down next to Betty Hawkins, and a great
depression stole over her. She knew perfectly well
that she could not be chosen as Rosalind in competition
with Dolly Morton or Blanche Jones, or indeed with
anyone at all.</p>

<p>She was feeling muzzier and muzzier every minute.
Her eyes were watery. Her nose was red. She knew
that with the best will in the world she was incapable
of giving full value to the beauty of Rosalind’s lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“<i>I show bore birth than I am bistress of</i>,” she quoted
softly to herself, “<i>and would you yet I were berrier?</i>”</p>

<p>No, it was quite hopeless. Moreover, Mrs. Morton
and Mrs. Jones were both very wealthy, and fairly
recent additions to the neighbourhood, and she had a
suspicion that Mrs. Hawkins was trying to ingratiate
herself with them. Yet she felt that she simply
couldn’t go on living if she didn’t get the part of Rosalind.
Mrs. Hawkins handed her a cup of tea. William
had wandered away. He had gone over to the bay
window where Mrs. Morton sat alone. Mrs. Morton
was inclined to be superior and wasn’t quite sure
whether or no she were compromising herself in any
way by allowing herself to be drawn into Mrs. Hawkins’
circle. So she sat as far aloof from it as she could.
Of course, she wanted Dolly to be chosen as Rosalind.
On the other hand, it was never wise to be too friendly
with people till you knew exactly where they stood.</p>

<p>William sat down on the window seat next to her,
watching Ethel morosely. Everyone must know that
she’d been drinking. Her nose was as red as anything
now.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Mrs. Morton said to him:</p>

<p>“Your sister doesn’t look very well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s all right,” said William absently. “I
mean, she’s all right in one way. She’s not ill or
anything.” Then he added casually: “It’s only that
she drinks.”</p>

<p>“<i>W-what?</i>” said Mrs. Morton, putting her cup down
hastily upon an occasional table, because she felt too
unnerved to hold it any longer.</p>

<p>“She drinks,” said William more clearly and with a
certain irritation at having to repeat himself. “Din’t
you hear what I said? I said she drinks. She keeps a
bottle of it in her room and locks the door an’ drinks
it. It’s that what makes her look like that.”</p>

<p>“B-but,” gasped Mrs. Morton, “how terrible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” asserted William carelessly, “it’s terrible all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
right. She takes it up to her bedroom in a bottle an’
locks the door and drinks it there, an’ then comes out
lookin’ like that.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_025">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“OH, ETHEL’S NOT ILL OR ANYTHING!” SAID WILLIAM.
“IT’S ONLY THAT SHE DRINKS.”<br>
<br>
“W-WHAT?” SAID MRS. MORTON.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mrs. Morton’s worst fears were justified. Whatever
sort of people had she let herself be drawn among?
She rose, summoned her daughter with a regal gesture,
and turning to Mrs. Hawkins said with magnificent
hauteur:</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mrs. Hawkins, but I’ve just remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
a most important engagement, and I’m afraid I must
go at once.”</p>

<p>And she swept out, followed by the meek Dolly.</p>

<p>Gradually Mrs. Hawkins recovered from her
paralysis.</p>

<p>“Well,” she gasped, “what simply extraordinary
behaviour! I never <i>heard</i>—— Well, I wouldn’t
have her daughter now for Rosalind not for a thousand
pounds.”</p>

<p>William, left high and dry on his window seat,
continued thoughtfully to consume cakes. Perhaps he
oughtn’t to have told her that. It had seemed to
upset her. Well, he wouldn’t tell anyone else, though
he did rather want people to know about the noble
work he was doing in reforming Ethel. What was
the use of reforming anyone if people didn’t know you
were doing it?</p>

<p>“William, dear,” said Mrs. Hawkins sweetly,
“would you like to go into the dining-room and see
if you can find anything you’d like to read on the
shelves there?”</p>

<p>William went, and conversation became general.</p>

<p>“Oh, I nearly forgot,” said Ethel to Betty Hawkins.
“Mother asked me to ask you to lend us a bon-bon
dish for the whist drive. We find we won’t have <i>quite</i>
enough after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rather. I’ll get one for you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother. Tell me where to get it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one on the silver table in the drawing-room.
I’ll get it and wrap it up for you.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t bother. I can slip it into my bag. I
can get out much more easily than you can.”</p>

<p>Thus it was that William, returning from the dining-room
to inform the company that he hadn’t been able
to find anything interesting to read, was met by the
sight of his sister creeping out of the morning-room
where everyone was assembled and going alone into
the empty drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>William glued his eye to the crack in the door and
watched her.</p>

<p>She took a piece of silver from a table and slipped
it into her hand-bag and then returned to the drawing-room,
without noticing him. He stood for a minute
motionless, amazed. Crumbs! <i>Crumbs!</i> She was
<i>just</i> like the girl in the book. She stole as well as
being a secret drinker. He must do something at once.
He must get the thing she’d stolen and put it back in
its place again. That was what the boy in the book
had done.</p>

<p>He returned to the morning-room. They hadn’t
begun the trial reading yet: they were all talking at
once. They were discussing recent social happenings
in the village. Mrs. Jones, as a newcomer, was feeling
slightly out of it, and Mrs. Jones had a lively sense of
her own importance and did not like feeling out of
it. She had previously, of course, been kept in countenance
by Mrs. Morton, and she was still wondering
what had made Mrs. Morton go off like that. But there
was no doubt at all that people weren’t making enough
fuss of her, so she rose and said with an air of great
dignity:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hawkins, I am suffering from a headache.
May I go into your drawing-room and lie down?”</p>

<p>She had often found that that focused the attention
of everyone upon her. It did in this instance. They
all leapt to their feet solicitously, fussed about her,
escorted her to the drawing-room, drew down the
blinds and left her well pleased with the stir she had
made.</p>

<p>This, she thought, ought to assure the part of
Rosalind for Blanche. They wouldn’t surely risk
making her headache worse by giving the part to anyone
else. Meanwhile, William was seated upon the
floor between Betty Hawkins and Ethel. His whole
attention was focused upon Ethel’s bag which she
had carelessly deposited upon the floor. Very slowly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
very furtively, inch by inch, William was drawing it
towards him. At last he was able to draw it behind
him. No one had seen. Betty and Ethel were talking
about the play.</p>

<p>“Do, I don’t really bind what I ab,” Ethel was saying,
untruthfully.</p>

<p>Very skilfully, William took the silver dish out of
the bag, slipped it into his pocket and put back the
bag where it had been before. Then, murmuring
something about going to look at the books again, he
slipped from the room and went back to the drawing-room
to replace it. He had quite forgotten Mrs.
Jones, but just as he was furtively replacing the
dish upon the table, her stern, accusing voice came
from the dark corner of the room where the couch
stood.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, boy?”</p>

<p>William jumped violently.</p>

<p>“I—I—I’m putting this back,” he explained.</p>

<p>“What did you take it away for?” said Mrs.
Jones still more sternly. William hastened to excuse
himself.</p>

<p>“I din’ take it,” he said. “Ethel took it,” then,
hastening to excuse Ethel. “She—she sort of can’t
help taking things. I always,” he added virtuously,
“try’n put back the things she’s took.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones raised herself, tall and dignified, from her
couch.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” she said, “that your sister
<i>stole</i> it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William. “She does steal things. We
always try’n put them back when we find things she’s
stole. I found this just now in her bag.”</p>

<p>“A kleptomaniac,” exclaimed Mrs. Jones, “and I
am expected to allow my daughter to associate with
such people!”</p>

<p>Quivering with indignation, she returned to the
morning-room. William followed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Feeling better?” said Mrs. Hawkins brightly,
“because if you are, I think we might begin the
reading.”</p>

<p>“I find,” said Mrs. Jones icily, “that I cannot,
after all, stay for the reading. I must be getting home
at once. Come, Blanche!”</p>

<p>When she’d gone, Mrs. Hawkins looked about her
in helpless amazement.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it <i>extraordinary</i>?” she said. “I simply can’t
understand it. It’s an absolute mystery to me what’s
come over them. Now, have I said a single thing that
could have annoyed them?”</p>

<p>They assured her that she hadn’t.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “it’s just as well to have no
dealings with people as unaccountable as that, so,
Ethel dear, you’d better take Rosalind after all.”</p>

<p>“Thag you so buch,” said Ethel gratefully.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a little cold, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hab,” admitted Ethel, “perhaps I’d better
go hobe dow. Bother asked me to ask you kidly to
led her a bod-bod dish ad Betty kidly let me hab this
frob the drawing-roob.”</p>

<p>She opened her bag.</p>

<p>“It’s god,” she gasped.</p>

<p>William was looking very inscrutable, but his mind
was working hard. There was more in this, he decided,
than had met his eye.</p>

<p>Betty had gone into the drawing-room and now
returned with the bon-bon dish.</p>

<p>“You never took it,” she said.</p>

<p>“But I did,” persisted Ethel. “I dow I did. It’s
bost bysterious.”</p>

<p>“You’d better get home to bed, my dear,” said Mrs.
Hawkins.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m <i>awfully</i> glad I’b goig to be Rosalid.
Cub od, Williab.”</p>

<p>William did not speak till they’d reached the road.
Then he said slowly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“She’d <i>lent</i> you that silver thing, Ethel?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Ethel shortly.</p>

<p>“An’—an’ you’ve—you’ve just got a bad cold?” he
continued.</p>

<p>Ethel did not consider this worth an answer, so
they walked on in silence.</p>

<p>“Well, dear?” said Mrs. Brown when they reached
home.</p>

<p>“I’b goig to be Rosalid,” said Ethel, “but I’ve
got a bit of co’d, so I think I’ll go to bed.” In her
relief at having been chosen as Rosalind, she became
expansive and confidential. “I knew I’d god a co’d
this borning, an’ I sneaked up that boddle of co’d
cure ad drank sobe id my bed roob, but it didn’t do
any good.”</p>

<p>William blinked.</p>

<p>“Was it—was it the cold cure stuff you were drinkin’
in your room, Ethel?”</p>

<p>“You’d better go to bed, too, William,” said his
mother. “The doctor said that you were to go to bed
early this week.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said William with unexpected meekness.
“I don’t mind going to bed.”</p>

<p>Still looking very thoughtful, William went to bed.</p>

<p>“Was he all right at Mrs. Hawkins’?” said his
mother anxiously to Ethel.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Ethel, “he was quite good.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” said Mrs. Brown, relieved, “because
you know he sometimes does such extraordinary things
when he goes out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Ethel, preparing to follow William up
to bed, “he was quite all right.” She was silent for a
minute, as she remembered the abrupt departures of
Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Jones, and the mysterious disappearance
of the bon-bon dish from her bag.</p>

<p>“Sobe rather fuddy things did happed,” she said,
“but Williab couldn’t possibly have beed respodsible
for any of theb.”</p>

WILLIAM—THE GREAT ACTOR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was announced in the village that the Literary
Society was going to give a play on Christmas Eve.
It was a tradition that a play should be given in the
village every Christmas Eve. It did not much matter
who gave it or what it was about or what it was in
aid of, but the village had begun to expect a play of some
sort on Christmas Eve. William’s sister Ethel and
her friends had at first decided to do scenes from “As
You Like It,” but this had fallen through partly
because Ethel had succumbed to influenza as soon as
the cast was arranged, and partly because of other
complications too involved to enter into.</p>

<p>So the Literary Society had stepped into the breach,
and had announced that it was going to act a play in
aid of its Cinematograph Fund. The Literary Society
was trying to collect enough money to buy a cinematograph.
Cinematographs, the President said, were
so educational. But that was not the only reason.
Membership of the Literary Society had lately begun
to fall alarmingly, chiefly because, as everyone freely
admitted, the meetings were so dull. They had
heard Miss Greene-Joanes read her paper on “The
Influence of Browning” five times, and they had had
the Debate on “That the Romantic School has contributed
more to Literature than the Classical School”
three times, and they’d had a Sale of Work and a
Treasure Hunt and a picnic and there didn’t seem to be
anything else to do in the literary line. Mrs. Bruce
Monkton-Bruce, the Secretary, said that it wasn’t her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
fault. She’d written to ask Bernard Shaw, Arnold
Bennett, E. Einstein, M. Coué and H. G. Wells to
come down to address them and it wasn’t her fault
that they hadn’t answered. She’d enclosed a stamped
addressed envelope in each case. More than once
they’d tried reading Shakespeare aloud, but it only
seemed to send the members to sleep and then they
woke up cross.</p>

<p>But the suggestion of the cinematograph had put
fresh life into the Society. There had been nearly six
new members (the sixth hadn’t quite made up her
mind) since the idea was first mooted. The more
earnest ones had dreams of watching improving films,
such as those depicting Sunrise on the Alps or the Life
of a Kidney Bean from the cradle to the grave, while
the less earnest ones considered that such films as
the “Three Musketeers” and “Monsieur Beaucaire”
were quite sufficiently improving. So far they had had
a little “Bring and Buy Sale” in aid of it, and had
raised five and elevenpence three farthings, but as
Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce had said that was not
nearly enough because they wanted a really good
one.</p>

<p>The play was the suggestion of one of the new
members, a Miss Gwladwyn. “That ought,” she said
optimistically, “to bring us in another pound or two.”</p>

<p>The tradition of the Christmas Eve plays in the
village included a silver collection at the door, but did
not include tickets. It was rightly felt that if the
village had to pay for its tickets, it would not come at
all. The silver collection at the door, too, was not as
lucrative as one would think because the village had
no compunction at all about walking past the plate as
if it did not see it even if it was held out right under its
nose. It was felt generally that “a pound or two”
was a rather too hopeful estimate. But still a pound,
as Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce so unanswerably pointed
out, was a pound, and anyway it would be good for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the Literary Society to get up a play. It would, she
said, with her incurable optimism, “draw them together.”
As a matter of fact, experience had frequently
proved the acting of a play to have precisely the
opposite effect.... They held a meeting to discuss
the nature of the play. There was an uneasy feeling
that they ought to do one of Shakespeare’s or
Sheridan’s, or, as Miss Formester put it, vaguely,
“something of Shelley’s or Keats’,” but the more
modest ones thought that though literary, they were
not quite as literary as that, and the less modest ones, as
represented by Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce, said quite
boldly and openly that though those authors had
doubtless suited their own generations, things had
progressed since then. She added that she’d once tried
to read “She Stoops to Conquer,” and hadn’t been able
to see what people saw in it.</p>

<p>“Of course,” admitted Miss Georgine Hemmersley,
“the men characters will be the difficulty.” (The
membership of the Literary Society was entirely
feminine). “I have often thought that perhaps it
would be a good thing to try to interest the men of
the neighbourhood in our little society.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Miss Featherstone doubtfully,
thinking of those pleasant little meetings of the Literary
Society, which were devoted to strong tea, iced cakes,
and interchanges of local scandal. “I don’t know.
Look at it how you will as soon as you begin to have
men in a thing, it complicates it at once. I’ve often
noticed it. There’s something <i>restless</i> about men. And
they aren’t literary. It’s no good pretending they
are.”</p>

<p>The Society sighed and agreed.</p>

<p>“Of course it has its disadvantages at a time like
this,” went on Miss Featherstone, “not having any
men, I mean, because, of course, it means that we can’t
act any modern plays. It means we have to fall back
on plays of historical times. I mean wigs and things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“I know,” said Miss Gwladwyn demurely, “a
perfectly sweet little historical play.”</p>

<p>“What period is it, dear?” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce.</p>

<p>“It’s the costume period,” said Miss Gwladwyn
simply. “You know. Wigs and ruffles and swords.
Tudor. Or is it Elizabethan? It’s about the Civil
War, anyway, and it’s really awfully sweet.”</p>

<p>“What’s the plot of it?” said the Literary Society
with interest.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Miss Gwladwyn, “the heroine” (a
certain modest bashfulness in Miss Gwladwyn’s mien
at this moment showed clearly that she expected
to be the heroine), “the heroine is engaged to a
Roundhead, but she isn’t really in love with him. At
least she thinks she is, but she isn’t. And a wounded
Cavalier comes to her house to take refuge in a terrible
storm, and she takes him in meaning to hand him over
to her <i>fiancé</i>, you know. Her father’s a Roundhead,
of course, you see. And then she falls in love with
him, with the Cavalier, I mean, and hides him, and
then the <i>fiancé</i> finds him and she tells him that she
doesn’t love him, but she loves the other. That’s an
awfully sweet scene. There’s a snow-storm. I’ve
forgotten exactly how the snow-storm comes in, but
I know that there is one, and it’s awfully effective.
You do it with tiny bits of paper dropped from above.
It makes an awfully sweet scene. There are heaps of
characters too,” she went on eagerly, “we could <i>all</i>
have quite good parts. There’s a comic aunt and a
comic uncle and awfully sweet parts for my—I mean
her parents and quite a lot of servants with really <i>good</i>
parts. There’d be parts and to spare for <i>everyone</i>.
Some of us could even take two. It’s an awfully sweet
thing altogether.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“Is it <i>literary</i> enough, do you think,” she said
uncertainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Oh <i>yes</i>,” said Miss Gwladwyn, earnestly. “It
<i>must</i> be. If it’s historical it <i>must</i> be literary, mustn’t
it? I mean, it <i>follows</i>, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Apparently the majority of the Literary Society
thought it did.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” said Miss Gwladwyn brightly, “I’ll get
the book and we’ll have a reading and then vote on
it. All I can say is that I’ve <i>seen</i> it and I’ve seen a
good many of Shakespeare’s plays too, and I consider
this a much sweeter thing than any of Shakespeare’s,
and if that doesn’t prove that it’s Literary I don’t
know what does.”</p>

<p>Again the Society seemed to find the logic unassailable
and the meeting broke up (after tea and
iced cake, a verbatim account of what Mrs. Jones said
to Mrs. Robinson when they’d quarrelled last week,
and a detailed description of the doctor’s wife’s new
hat), arranging to meet the next week and read Miss
Gwladwyn’s play.</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i> that you’ll like it,” was Miss Gwladwyn’s
final assurance as she took her leave. “It’s such an
awfully sweet little thing.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The meeting took place early the next week. Miss
Gwladwyn opened it by artlessly suggesting that
as she’d seen the play before she should read the
heroine’s part. It was generally felt that as she
had introduced the play to them, this was only her
due.</p>

<p>The first scene was read fairly briskly. It abounded,
however, in such stage directions as “When door
opens howling of wind is heard outside.” “Crash of
thunder without,” and such remarks as: “Hark how
the storm does rage to-night,” and: “Hear the beating
of the rain upon the window-panes.” “Listen! Do
you not hear the sound of horses’ hoofs?”</p>

<p>At the end of the scene Miss Georgine Hemmersley
(who was a notorious pessimist) remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“It will be very difficult to get those noises made.”</p>

<p>“Those who aren’t on the stage must make them,”
said Miss Gwladwyn.</p>

<p>“But we’re all on the stage in this scene,” objected
Miss Georgine Hemmersley.</p>

<p>“Then we must have a special person to make them,”
said Miss Gwladwyn.</p>

<p>Miss Georgine Hemmersley threw her eye over the
stage directions.</p>

<p>“They’ll be very difficult to make,” she said,
“especially the wind. How does one make the sound
of wind?”</p>

<p>“A sort of whistle, I suppose,” said Miss Gwladwyn
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” said Miss Georgine Hemmersley, “but
<i>how</i>? I mean, <i>I</i> couldn’t do it, for instance.”</p>

<p>At that moment William passed down the street
outside.</p>

<p>William was whistling—not his usual piercing blast
of a whistle, but a slow, mournful, meditative whistle.
As a matter of fact he was not aware that he was
whistling at all. His mind was occupied with a deep
and apparently insoluble problem—the problem of how
to obtain a new football with no money or credit at
his disposal. Only such an optimist as William would
have tackled the problem at all. But William walking
down the street, hands in pockets, scowling gaze fixed
on the ground mechanically and unconsciously emitting
a tuneless monotonous undertone of a whistle, was
convinced that there must be a solution of the problem
if only he could think of it.... If only he could think
of it.... He passed by Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce’s
open window and his whistle fell upon a sudden silence
within.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce.</p>

<p>Miss Georgine Hemmersley went to the window.</p>

<p>“It’s just a boy,” she said.</p>

<p>Miss Gwladwyn followed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“It’s that rough-looking boy one sees about so
much,” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce joined them at the
window.</p>

<p>“It’s William Brown,” she said.</p>

<p>They stood at the open window while William, wholly
unconscious of their regard, still grappling mentally
with his insoluble problem, passed on his way. His
faint tuneless strain floated back to them.</p>

<p>“It—it <i>does</i> sound like the wind,” said Miss
Gwladwyn.</p>

<p>On an impulse Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce put her
head out of the window.</p>

<p>“William Brown!” she called sharply. “Come here.”</p>

<p>William turned and scowled at her aggressively.</p>

<p>“I’ve not done nothin’,” he said. “It wasn’t <i>me</i>
you saw chasin’ your cat yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Come in here, William,” she said. “We want to
ask you something.”</p>

<p>William stood hesitating, not sure whether to obey
or whether to show his contempt of her by continuing
his thoughtful progress down the street.</p>

<p>They probably only wanted him in to make a fuss
about something he’d not done. Well, not <i>meant</i>
to do anyway; well, not worth making a fuss about
anyway. On the other hand it might be something
else and if he went on he’d never know what they’d
wanted him for. His curiosity won the day.</p>

<p>Taking a piece of chewing-gum, which he had absently
been carrying in his mouth, from his mouth to his
pocket, he proceeded to hoist himself up to the window sill
whence he had been summoned.</p>

<p>“<i>Not</i> that way, William!” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce
sternly. “Come in by the front door, please,
in the usual way.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">WILLIAM SCOWLED AGGRESSIVELY. “I’VE NOT DONE
NOTHIN’,” HE SAID.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>William lowered himself to the street again, put the
chewing-gum back into his mouth, stood for a minute
obviously wondering whether it was worth while to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
in by the front door in the usual way, decided
apparently that though it probably wasn’t, still there
was just a chance that it might be, then, very, very
slowly (as if to prove his complete independence,
despite his show of obedience), went round to the
front door.</p>

<p>“You may open the door and come in,” called Mrs.
Bruce Monkton-Bruce from the window, “and don’t
forget to wipe your feet.”</p>

<p>William opened the door and came in. He wiped
his feet with a commendable and very lengthy thoroughness
(whose object was to keep them waiting for
him as long as possible), transferred his chewing-gum
from his mouth to his pocket again, carefully arranged
his cap between the horns of the stuffed head of an
antelope which was hanging on the wall, thought better
of it and transferred it to the stuffed head of a fox,
which was hanging on the opposite wall, gazed critically
for a long time at a stuffed owl in a cage, absently
broke off a piece of a fern that grew in a plant pot
next to the hat-stand, and finally entered the drawing-room.
He stood in the doorway facing them, still
scowling aggressively and scattering bits of fern upon
the carpet. His mind went quickly over the more
recent events of his career in order to account for the
summons. He was already regretting having obeyed
it. He decided to take the offensive. Fixing a
stern and scowling gaze upon Miss Greene-Joanes, he
said:</p>

<p>“When you saw me in your garden yesterday I was
jus’ gettin’ a ball of mine that’d gone over the wall
into your garden. I was simply tryin’ to save you
trouble by goin’ an’ gettin’ it myself, ’stead of troublin’
you goin’ to the front door. An’ that apple was one
what I found lyin’ under your tree an’ I thought I’d
pick it up for you jus’ to help you tidy up the place
’cause it looks so untidy with apples lyin’ about under
the trees all over the place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“William,” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce, “we
did not ask you to come in in order to discuss your
visit to Miss Greene-Joanes’ garden——”</p>

<p>William turned his steely eye upon her and pursued
his policy of taking the offensive.</p>

<p>“Those stones you saw me throwin’ at your tree,”
he said, “was jus’ to kill grubs ’n’ things what might
be doin’ it harm. I thought I’d help you keep your
garden nice by throwin’ stones at your tree to kill the
grubs ’n’ things on it for you ’cause they were eatin’
away the bark or somethin’.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t bring you in to talk about that either,
William,” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce. Then,
clearing her throat, she said: “You were whistling as
you went down the road, were you not?”</p>

<p>William’s stern and freckled countenance expressed
horror and amazement.</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” he said. “<i>Well!</i> I bet I was hardly
makin’ any noise at all. ’Sides”—aggressively—“there’s
nothin’ to stop folks jus’ <i>whistlin’</i>, is there?
In the <i>street</i>. If they <i>want</i> to. I wasn’t doin’ you any
<i>harm</i>, was I? Jus’ <i>whistlin’</i> in the <i>street</i>. If you’ve
gotta headache or anythin’ an’ don’ want me to I won’t
not till I get into the nex’ street where you won’t
hear me. Not now I know. You needn’t’ve brought
me <i>in</i> jus’ to say that. If you’d jus’ shouted it out of
the window I’d’ve heard all right. But I don’t see
you can blame me jus’ for——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce held out a hand feebly
to stem the tide of his eloquence.</p>

<p>“It’s not that, William,” she said faintly. “Do
stop talking for two minutes, and let me speak. We—we
were <i>interested</i> in your whistle. Would you—would
you kindly repeat it in here—just to let us hear
again what it sounds like?”</p>

<p>William was proud of his whistle and flattered to
be thus asked to perform in public. He paused a
minute to gather his forces together, drew in his breath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
then emitted a sound that would have done credit to
a factory syren.</p>

<p>Miss Georgine Hemmersley screamed. Miss Gwladwyn,
who was poised girlishly on the arm of her chair,
lost her balance and fell on to the floor. Mrs. Bruce
Monkton-Bruce clapped her hands to her ears with a
moan of agony and Miss Greene-Joanes lay back in
her chair in a dead faint, from which, however, as no
one took any notice of her, she quickly recovered.
William, immensely flattered by this reception of his
performance, murmured modestly:</p>

<p>“I can do a better one still this way,” and proceeded
to put a finger into each corner of his mouth and to
draw in his breath for another blast.</p>

<p>With great presence of mind, Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce
managed to put her hand across his face just
in time.</p>

<p>“No, William,” she said brokenly, “not like that—not
like that——”</p>

<p>“I warn you,” said Miss Greene-Joanes, in a shrill,
trembling voice, “I shall have hysterics if he does it
again. I’ve already fainted,” she went on, in a
reproachful voice, “but nobody noticed me. I won’t
be answerable for what happens to me if that boy stays
in the room a minute longer.”</p>

<p>“Send him away,” moaned Miss Featherstone, “and
let’s <i>imagine</i> the wind.”</p>

<p>“Let’s leave it to chance,” pleaded Miss Greene-Joanes.
“I can’t bear it again. There—there may
be a <i>natural</i> wind that night. It’s quite possible.”</p>

<p>“William,” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce weakly,
“it was a gentle whistle we wanted to hear. A whistle
like—like—like the wind in the distance. A <i>long</i> way
in the distance, William.”</p>

<p>William emitted a gentle, drawn-out, mournful
whistle. It represented perfectly the distant moaning
of the wind. His stricken audience recovered and
gave a gasp of amazement and delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“That was <i>very</i> nice,” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce.</p>

<p>William, cheered and flattered by her praise, said:
“I’ll do it a bit nearer than that now,” and again
gathered his forces for the effort.</p>

<p>“No, William,” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce
again stopping him just in time. “That’s as near as
we want. That’s <i>just</i> what we want.... Now,
William, we are going to get up a little play, and
during the play the wind is supposed to be heard
right in the distance—a long, <i>long</i> way in the distance,
William. The wind is supposed to be a <i>very</i> distant
one indeed, William. Perhaps for a very great treat
we’ll let you make that wind, William.”</p>

<p>William’s mind worked quickly. The apparently
insoluble problem was still with him. He saw a means,
not to solve it indeed, but to make it a little less
insoluble. Assuming his most sphinx-like expression
he said unblushingly, unblinkingly:</p>

<p>“Well, of course—that’ll take up a good deal of my
time. I dunno <i>quite</i> as I can spare all that time.”</p>

<p>They were amazed at his effrontery and at the same
time his astounding and unexpected reluctance to
accept the post of wind-maker increased the desirability
of his whistle in their eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course, William,” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce
in cold reproach, “if you don’t want to help in
a good cause like this——” Wisely she kept the exact
nature of the good cause vague.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’ mind <i>helpin’</i>,” said William; “all I
meant was that it’d probably be takin’ up a good
deal of my time when I might be doin’ useful things
for other people. F’rinstance, I often pump up my
uncle’s motor tyres for him.” William’s face became
so expressionless as to border on the imbecile as he
added: “He always gives me sixpence for doing that.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence and then Mrs. Bruce
Monkton-Bruce said with great dignity:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“We will, of course, be pleased to give you sixpence
for being the wind and any other little noises that may
come into the play, William.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said William, concealing his delight
beneath a tone of calm indifference. Sixpence ... it
was something to start from. William was such an
optimist that with the first sixpence the whole fund
seemed suddenly to be assured to him.... He could
do something else for someone else and get another
sixpence and that would be a shilling, and, well, if he
kept on doing things for people for sixpence he’d soon
have enough money to buy the football. Optimistically
he ignored the fact that most people expected him to
do things for them for nothing....</p>

<p>It was arranged that William should attend the
next reading of the play in order to be the wind and
whatever other noises might be necessary, and then
William, transferring his chewing-gum from his pocket
to his mouth and scattering bits of fern absently to
mark his path as he went, disappeared into the hall,
took his cap from the fox’s head, pulled a face at the
stuffed owl, then, seeming annoyed by its equanimity,
pulled another, absently plucked off another spray
of Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce’s cherished fern, and
made his devastating way into the street. His
piercing and unharmonious whistle shattered the
quiet of countless peaceful homes as he strode onwards,
cheered and invigorated by his visit, looking forward
with equal joy to his rôle as wind-maker and his
possession of the sixpence that was to be the nucleus
of his football fund.</p>

<p>The members of the Literary Society heaved sighs
of relief as the sounds of his departure faded into the
distance.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” said Miss Greene-Joanes
pathetically, “that we could find a <i>quieter</i> type of
boy.”</p>

<p>“But it <i>was</i>,” said Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce, “it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
<i>was</i> a <i>very</i> good imitation of the wind. I mean, of
course, when he did it softly.”</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t a quieter type of boy do?” persisted
Miss Greene-Joanes. “For instance, there’s that dear
little Cuthbert Montgomery.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t whistle,” objected Mrs. Bruce
Monkton-Bruce. “I’m afraid that you’d always
find that the quiet type of boy couldn’t do such a
good whistle.”</p>

<p>So reluctantly the Literary Society decided to
appoint William as the wind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>William put in an early appearance at the next
rehearsal. It was in fact a little too early for Mrs.
Bruce Monkton-Bruce, at whose house it was held.
He arrived half an hour before the time at which it was
to begin and spent the half-hour sitting in her drawing-room
cracking nuts and practising his whistle. Mrs.
Bruce Monkton-Bruce said that it gave her a headache
that lasted for a week.</p>

<p>“William,” she said sternly when she entered the
drawing-room, “if you don’t learn to do a <i>quiet</i> whistle
we won’t have you at all.”</p>

<p>“<i>Wasn’t</i> that quiet?” said William, surprised. “It
seemed to me to be such a quiet sort of whistle that
I’m surprised you heard it at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I <i>did</i>,” she snapped, “and it’s given me a
headache, and don’t do it any more.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said William succinctly, transferring his
whole attention to his nuts.</p>

<p>Her tone had conveyed to him that his position
as wind-maker was rather precarious, so when the
other members of the cast arrived he made his wind
whistle so low that they had to request him to do
it a <i>leetle</i>—just a <i>very leetle</i>—louder. Even then it
sounded very faint and far away. William had decided
not to risk either his sixpence or his place in the
cast by whistling too loudly at rehearsals. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
actual performance of course would be quite a different
matter. His gentle whistle endeared him to them.
They unbent to him. He was turning out, Miss
Featherstone confided to Miss Gwladwyn in a whisper,
a nicer type of boy than she had feared he would at
first. He had helpful suggestions too about the
other noises. He knew how to make the sound of
horses’ hooves. You did it with a coco-nut. And
he knew how to make thunder. You did it with a
tin tray. And he could make revolver shots by
letting off caps or squibs or something. Anyway,
he could do it somehow.... They thought that
perhaps he’d better not try those things till nearer
the time. He’d better confine himself to the wind—so
he confined himself to the wind, a gentle, anæmic
sort of wind which he despised in his heart, but
which he felt was winning him the confidence of his
new friends. They unbent to him more and more.
He was rather annoyed that he was not to have
the snow-storm. Miss Gwladwyn said that her
nephew would manage the snow-storm. She said
that her nephew was a dear little boy with beautiful
manners, who she admitted regretfully could not
whistle, and might not be able to manage the other
noises, but would, she was sure, manage the snow-storm
perfectly.</p>

<p>William went home fortified by their praise of his
distant whistle and two buns given him by Mrs.
Bruce Monkton-Bruce. On the way he met Douglas
and Henry and Ginger.</p>

<p>“Hello,” they said, “where’ve you been?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been to a rehearsal,” said William with his
own inimitable swagger. “I’m actin’ in a play.”</p>

<p>They were as impressed as even William could
wish them to be.</p>

<p>“What play?” demanded Ginger.</p>

<p>“One the Lit’ry Society’s gettin’ up,” said William
airily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“What’s it called?” said Douglas.</p>

<p>William did not know what it was called, so he said
with an air of careless importance:</p>

<p>“That’s a secret. I’ve not got to tell anyone that.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you actin’ in it?” said Henry.</p>

<p>William’s swagger increased.</p>

<p>“I’m the most important person in it,” he said.
“They jolly well couldn’t do it at all without me.”</p>

<p>“You the <i>hero</i>?” said Ginger incredulously.</p>

<p>“Um,” admitted William. “That’s what I am.”</p>

<p>After all, he thought, surely in a play where you
were continually hearing and talking about the wind,
the wind might be referred to as the hero. Anyway,
he soothed his conscience by telling it that as he was
the only man in the piece, he <i>must</i> be the hero.</p>

<p>“They’re all women,” he continued carelessly,
“so of course they had to get a man in from somewhere
to be the hero.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws were not quite convinced, and yet there
was <i>something</i> about William’s swagger....</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ginger, “I s’pose if you’re the hero
you’ll be havin’ rehearsals with ’em?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William. “Course <i>I</i> will!”</p>

<p>“All right,” challenged Ginger. “Tell us where
you’re havin’ the nex’ one an’ we’ll <i>see</i>.”</p>

<p>“At Mrs. Bruce’s nex’ Tuesday afternoon at three,”
said William promptly.</p>

<p>“All <i>right</i>,” said the Outlaws, “an’ we’ll jolly well
<i>see</i>.”</p>

<p>So next Tuesday at three o’clock they jolly well
<i>saw</i>. Hidden in the bushes in Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce’s
(let us call her by her full name. She hated
to hear it as she said “murdered”) garden they saw
the cast of “A Trial of Love” arrive one by one at
the front door. And with them arrived William—the
only male character—swaggering self-consciously but
quite obviously as an invited guest up Mrs. Bruce
Monkton-Bruce’s front drive. He was fully aware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
of the presence of his friends in the bushes, though
he appeared not to notice them. His swagger as he
walked in at the front door is indescribable.</p>

<p>The Outlaws crept away silent and deeply impressed.
It was true. William must be the hero of the play.
They were torn between envy of their leader and pride
in him. Though all of them would have liked to be
the hero of a play, still they could shine in William’s
reflected glory. Their walk as they went away from
Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce’s front gate reflected
something of William’s swagger. William was a hero
in a play. Well, people’d have to treat them <i>all</i> a
bit diff’rent after that.</p>

<p>The rehearsal was on the whole a great success.
William, afraid that his friends might be listening
at the window and not wishing them to guess the
comparative insignificance of his rôle, reduced his
whistle to a mere breath. Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce
said encouragingly: “Just a <i>leetle</i> louder,
William,” but Miss Greene-Joanes said hastily: “Well,
perhaps it would be as well to keep it like that for
rehearsals, dear, and to bring it out just a <i>leetle</i> bit
louder on the night.”</p>

<p>So William, still afraid that the Outlaws were
crouched intently outside the window, kept it like that.</p>

<p>It was decided at the end that William need not
attend all the rehearsals. The cast found his stare
demoralising, and his habit of transferring his piece
of chewing-gum (he’d had it for three weeks now)
from his mouth to his pocket and from his pocket to
his mouth disconcerting. Also he would at intervals
take a nut from another pocket and crack it with
much noise and facial contortion. He always made
a very ostentatious show of collecting all the shells
and putting them into yet another pocket, but Mrs.
Bruce Monkton-Bruce’s horrified gaze watched a little
heap of broken nutshells steadily growing upon her
precious carpet by William’s feet. William himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
fondly imagined that he was behaving in an exemplary
way. He had even offered each of them one of his
nuts and had been secretly much relieved at their
refusal. They could not, he thought, expect him to
offer them a chew of his chewing-gum.... But he
was supremely bored and was not sorry when informed
that it would be best for them to rehearse the play
without wind and thunder till they were a little more
accustomed to it.</p>

<p>He was not summoned to another rehearsal for a
fortnight. The play was, as Miss Georgine Hemmersley
said, “taking shape beautifully.” Miss
Georgine Hemmersley as a Cavalier looked quite
dashing, despite her forty-odd years, and Miss Featherstone
as the Roundhead looked also very fine, though
she too had passed her first youth. It was, however,
as she said, only fair that those who had been in the
society longest should have the best parts.... Miss
Gwladwyn, they all agreed, made a sweetly pretty
heroine.</p>

<p>William arrived with all his paraphernalia of
coco-nuts and squibs and tin tray, and, he considered,
put up the best show of all of them. True, the rest of
the cast seemed a little irritable. They kept saying:
“<i>Quietly</i>, William.” “William, not so <i>loud</i>.”
“William, we can’t hear ourselves speak.” “William,
stop making that <i>deafening</i> noise. Well, there isn’t
any wind now.” At the end Miss Greene-Joanes, who
had seemed strangely excited all the time, burst out:</p>

<p>“Now, I’ve got some news for you all.... William,
you needn’t stay.” William began to make elaborate
and protracted preparations for his departure, but,
intensely curious, lingered within earshot. “I didn’t
tell you before we began, because I knew it would
make you too excited to act. It did me. You’ll
never <i>guess</i> who’s staying in the village.”</p>

<p>“<i>Who?</i>” chorused the cast breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Sir Giles Hampton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>The cast uttered screams of excitement. The
Cavalier said, “What for?” and the Roundhead said,
“Who told you?” and the comic aunt and uncle said
simultaneously, “Good <i>heavens</i>!”</p>

<p>“He’s had a nervous breakdown,” said Miss Greene-Joanes,
“and he’s staying at the inn here because
of the air, and he’s supposed to be incognito, but of
<i>course</i> people recognise him. As a matter of fact,
he’s telling people who he is because he’s not <i>really</i>
keen on being incognito. Actors never are really.
They feel frightfully mad if people don’t recognise
them.”</p>

<p>“What’s he like to look at?” said the comic aunt
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Tall and important-looking and rather handsome
with very bushy eyebrows.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll <i>come</i>?” said all the cast
simultaneously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but—— William, <i>will</i> you go home
and stop dropping nutshells on the carpet.”</p>

<p>There was a silence while all the cast waited
impatiently for William to take his leave. With
great dignity William took it. He was annoyed at his
unceremonious ejection. Thinking such a lot of
themselves and their old play, and where would they
be, he’d like to know, without the wind and the
thunder and the horses’ hooves and all the rest of
it?... Treating the most important person in the
play the way they treated him....</p>

<p>He walked down the road scowling morosely,
absent-mindedly cracking nuts and scattering nutshells
about him as he went.... At the end of the
road he collided with a tall man with bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>“You should look where you’re going, my little
man,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Come to that, so should you,” remarked William,
who was still feeling embittered.</p>

<p>The tall man blinked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Do you know who I am?” he said majestically.</p>

<p>“No,” said William simply, “an’ I bet you don’t
know who I am either.”</p>

<p>“I’m a very great actor,” said the man.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” said William promptly.</p>

<p>“So great,” went on the man, “that when they want
me to play a part they give me any money I choose
to ask for it.”</p>

<p>“I’m that sort, too,” said William, thrusting his
hands deep into his trouser pockets. “I asked for
sixpence an’ they gave it me straight off. It’s goin’
to a new football.”</p>

<p>“And do you know why I’m here, my little man?”
said the stranger.</p>

<p>“No,” said William without much interest and
added: “I’m here because I live here.”</p>

<p>“I’m here,” said the man, “because of my nerves.
Acting has exhausted my vitality and impaired my
nervous system. I’m an artist, and like most other
artists am highly strung. Do you know that sometimes
before I go on to the stage I tremble from head
to foot.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said William coolly. “I never feel like
that when I’m actin’.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” smiled the man, “but I’m always the most
important person in the plays I act in.”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” retorted William. “I’m like that. I’m
the most important person in the play I’m in now.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the programme of the
play I’ve just been acting in in London?” continued
the actor, taking a piece of paper out of his pocket.</p>

<p>William looked at it with interest. It contained a
list of names in ordinary-sized print; then an “and”
and then “Giles Hampton” in large letters.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William calmly, “that’s the way my
name’s goin’ to be printed in our play.”</p>

<p>“What play is it?” said the man yielding at last
to William’s irresistible egotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“It’s called ‘The Trial of Love,’” said William.
“It’s for my football an’ their cinematograph.”</p>

<p>“Ha-ha!” said the man. “And may—may—ah—distinguished
strangers come to it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William casually, “<i>anyone</i> can come
to it. You’ve gotter pay at least. Everyone’s gotter
pay.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must certainly come,” said the distinguished
stranger. “I must certainly come and see you play
the hero.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The dress rehearsal was not an unqualified success,
but as Miss Featherstone said that was always a sign
that the real performance would go off well. In all
the most successful plays, she said, the dress rehearsal
went off badly. William quite dispassionately considered
them the worst-tempered set of people he’d
ever come across in his life. They snapped at him
if he so much as spoke. They said that his wind was
far too loud, though it was in his opinion so faint and
distant a breeze that it was hardly worth doing at
all. They objected also to his thunder and his horses’
hooves. They said quite untruly that they were
deafening. A deep disgust with the whole proceedings
was growing stronger and stronger in William’s breast.
He felt that it would serve them right if he washed
his hands of the whole thing and refused to make
any of their noises for them. The only reason why
he did not do this was that he was afraid that if he
did they’d find someone else to do it in his place.
Moreover he was feeling worried about another matter.
He was aware that he did not take in the play such
an important part as he had given his friends to
understand. He had given them to understand that
he took the principal part and was on the stage all
the time, whereas, though he quite honestly considered
that he took the principal part, he wasn’t on the stage
at all. Then there was that man with bushy eyebrows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
he’d met in the village. He’d probably come,
and William had quite given him to understand that
he had his name on the programme in big letters and
took a principal part....</p>

<p>“<i>Thunder</i>, William,” said Miss Gwladwyn irritably,
interrupting his meditations. “Why don’t you keep
awake and follow where we are!”</p>

<p>William emitted a piercing whistle.</p>

<p>“Not <i>wind</i>,” she snapped. “<i>Thunder.</i>”</p>

<p>William beat on his tin tray.</p>

<p>Miss Greene-Joanes groaned.</p>

<p>“That noise,” she said, “goes through and <i>through</i>
my head. I can’t bear it!”</p>

<p>“Well, thunder is loud,” said William coldly. “It’s
nachrally loud. I can’t help thunder bein’ nachrally
loud.”</p>

<p>“Thunder more gently, William,” commanded Mrs.
Bruce Monkton-Bruce.</p>

<p>Just to annoy them William made an almost
inaudible rumble of thunder, but to his own great
annoyance it didn’t annoy them at all. “That’s
better, William,” they said; and gloomily William
returned to his meditation. He’d seen the programme
and had hardly been able to believe his eyes when
he saw that his name wasn’t on it at all. They
hadn’t even got his name down as the wind or the
thunder or the horses’ hooves or anything.... If it
hadn’t been for that sixpence he’d certainly have
chucked up the whole thing....</p>

<p>They’d got to the snow-storm scene now. The
curtains were half drawn across and in the narrow
aperture appeared Miss Gwladwyn, the heroine. It
was a very complicated plot, but at this stage of it
she’d been turned out of her home by her cruel Roundhead
father and was wandering in search of her lost
Cavalier lover.</p>

<p>She said: “How cold it is! Heaven, wilt thou
show me any pity?” and turned her face up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
sky, and tiny snow-flakes began to fall upon her face.
The tiny snow-flakes were tiny bits of paper dropped
down through a tiny opening in the ceiling by her
well-mannered little nephew. He did it very nicely.
William did not pay much attention to it. He was
beginning to consider the whole thing beneath his
contempt.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was the evening of the performance. The
performers were making frenzied preparations behind
the scenes. Mr. Fleuster was to draw the curtain,
Miss Featherstone’s sister was to prompt, and William
was to hand out programmes. Mr. Fleuster has not
come into this story before, but he had been trying
to propose to Miss Gwladwyn for the last five years
and had not yet been able to manage it. Both Miss
Gwladwyn and Miss Gwladwyn’s friends had given
him ample opportunities, but opportunities only
seemed to make him yet more bashful. When he had
not an opportunity he longed to propose, and when
an opportunity of proposing came he lost his head and
didn’t do it. Miss Gwladwyn had done everything
a really nice woman can do; that is to say, she had
done everything short of actually proposing herself.
Her friends had arranged for him to draw the curtain
in the hopes that it would bring matters to a head.
Not that they really expected that it would. It would,
of course, be a good opportunity, and as such would
fill him with terror and dismay.</p>

<p>Mr. Fleuster, large and perspiring, stood by the
curtain, pretending not to see that Miss Gwladwyn
was standing quite near him and that no one else
was within earshot, and that it was an excellent
opportunity.</p>

<p>William stood sphinx-like at the door distributing
programmes. His cogitations had not been entirely
profitless. He had devised means by which he hoped
to vindicate his position as hero. For one thing he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
had laboriously printed out four special programmes
which he held concealed beneath the ordinary
programmes, and which were to be distributed to
Ginger, Douglas, Henry, and the actor, if the actor
should come. He had copied down the dramatis
personæ from the ordinary programme, but at the
end he had put an “and” and then in gigantic letters:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Wind</td><td>              Shots </td><td rowspan="4">       <img src="images/brace.jpg" alt="brace"></td><td rowspan="4">William Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rain </td><td>             And All</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Thunder </td><td>          Other Noises</td></tr>                  
<tr><td>Horses’ Hooves</td><td>   &#160; </td></tr>    
</table>

<p>Seeing Ginger coming he hastily got one of his
home-made programmes out and assuming his blankest
expression handed it to him.</p>

<p>“Good ole William,” murmured Ginger as he took it.</p>

<p>Then Henry came, and Henry also was given one.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you changin’ into your things?” said
Henry.</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>ackshully</i> come on to the stage,” admitted
William. “I’m the most important person in the play
as you’ll soon jolly well see, but I don’t <i>ackshully</i> come
on to the stage.”</p>

<p>He was glad to have got that confession off his chest.</p>

<p>Then Douglas came. He handed the third of his
privately printed programmes to Douglas with an air
of impersonal officialism, as if he were too deeply
occupied in his duties to be able to recognise his friends.</p>

<p>There was only one left. That was for the actor.
If the actor came. William peered anxiously down the
road. The room was full. It was time to begin.</p>

<p>“William Brown!” an exasperated voice hissed
down the room. William swelled with importance.
Everyone would know now that they couldn’t begin
without him. He continued to gaze anxiously down
the road. There he was at last.</p>

<p>“William <i>Brown</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>The actor was almost at the door. He carried a
parcel under his arm.</p>

<p>“William Brown,” said someone in the back row
obligingly, “they want you.”</p>

<p>“<i>William—Brown!</i>” hissed Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce’s
face, appearing frenzied and bodiless like the
Cheshire cat between the curtains.</p>

<p>The actor entered the hall. William thrust his one
remaining programme into his hand.</p>

<p>“Thought you were the hero,” said the actor, gazing
at him sardonically.</p>

<p>William met his sardonic gaze unblinkingly.</p>

<p>“So I am,” he said promptly, “but the hero doesn’t
<i>always</i> come on to the stage. Not in the <i>newest</i> sort
of plays, anyway.” He pointed to the large-lettered
part of the programme. “That’s me,” he said
modestly. “All of it’s me.”</p>

<p>With this he hastened back behind the curtain,
leaving the actor reading his programme at the end
of the room.</p>

<p>He was received with acrimony by a nerve-racked
cast.</p>

<p>“Keeping us all waiting all this time.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you <i>hear</i> us calling?”</p>

<p>“It’s nearly twenty-five to.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said William in a superior manner
that maddened them still further. “You can begin
now.”</p>

<p>Miss Featherstone’s sister took her prompt-book,
Mr. Fleuster seized the curtain-strings, the cast
entered the stage, William took his seat behind,
and the play began.</p>

<p>Now William’s plans for making himself the central
figure of the play did not stop with the programmes.
He considered that the noises he had been allowed to
make at the rehearsals had been pitifully inadequate,
and he intended to-night to produce a storm more
worthy of his powers. Who ever heard of the wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
howling in a storm the way they’d made him howl
all these weeks? He knew what the wind howling in
a storm sounded like and he’d jolly well make it sound
like that. There was his cue. Someone was saying:</p>

<p>“Hark how the storm rages. Canst hear the wind?”</p>

<p>At the ensuing sound the prompter dropped her
book and the heroine lost her balance and brought
down the property mantelpiece on to the top of her.
William had put a finger into each corner of his mouth
in order to aid nature in the rendering of the storm.
The sound was even more piercing than he had expected
it to be. <i>That</i>, thought William, complacently noticing
the havoc it played with both audience and cast,
was something like a wind. That would show ’em
whether he was the hero of the play or not. With
admirable presence of mind the cast pulled itself
together and continued. William’s next cue was the
thunder.</p>

<p>“List,” said the heroine, “how the thunder rages
in the valley.”</p>

<p>The thunder raged and continued to rage. For
some minutes the cast remained silent and motionless—except
for facial contortions expressive of horror and
despair—waiting for the thunder to abate, but as it
showed no signs of stopping they tried to proceed.
It was, however, raging so violently that no one
could hear a word, so they had to stop again.</p>

<p>At last even its maker tired of it and it died away.
The play proceeded. Behind the scenes William
smiled again to himself. <i>That</i> had been a jolly good
bit of thunder. He’d really enjoyed that. And it
would jolly well let them all know he was there even
if he wasn’t dressed up and on the stage like the
others. His next cue was the horses’ hooves, and
William was feeling a little nervous about that. The
sound of horses’ hooves is made with a coco-nut,
and though William had managed to take his coco-nut
(purchased for him by Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
about with him all the time the play was in rehearsal,
he had as recently as last night succumbed to temptation
and eaten it. He didn’t quite know what to
do about the horses’ hooves. He hadn’t dared to tell
anyone about it. But still he thought he’d be able
to manage it. Here it was coming now.</p>

<p>“Listen,” Miss Gwladwyn was saying. “I hear the
sound of horses’ hooves.”</p>

<p>Then in the silence came the sound of a tin tray
being hit slowly, loudly, regularly. The audience
gave a yell of laughter. William felt annoyed. He
hadn’t meant it to sound like that. It wasn’t anything
to laugh at, anyway. He showed his annoyance by
another deafening and protracted thunderstorm.</p>

<p>When this had died away the play proceeded.
William’s part in that scene was officially over. But
William did not wish to withdraw from the public eye.
It occurred to him that in all probability the wind
and the thunder still continued. Yes, somebody
mentioned again that it was a wild night to be out in.
Come to that, the war must be going on all the time.
There were probably battles going on all over the
place. He’d better throw a few squibs about and
make a bit more wind and thunder. He set to work
with commendable thoroughness.</p>

<p>At last the end of the scene came. Mr. Fleuster
drew the curtains and chaos reigned. Most of the
cast attacked William, but some of them were attacking
each other, and quite a lot of them were attacking the
prompter. They had on several occasions forgotten
their words and not once had the prompter come to
their rescue. On one occasion they had wandered
on to Act II. and stayed there a considerable time.
The prompter’s plea that she’d lost her place right
at the very beginning and hadn’t been able to find it
again was not accepted as an excuse. Then Miss
Hemmersley was annoyed with Miss Featherstone
for giving her the wrong cues all the way through,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and Miss Gwladwyn was annoyed with Miss Greene-Joanes
for cutting into her monologue, and Miss
Greene-Joanes was annoyed with Mrs. Bruce Monkton-Bruce
for standing just where she prevented the
audience having a good view of her (Miss Greene-Joanes),
and when they couldn’t find anyone else to
be annoyed with they turned on William. Fortunately
for William, however, there was little time
for recrimination, as already the audience was clamouring
for the second scene. This was the snow-storm
scene. Miss Gwladwyn had installed her beautifully-mannered
nephew in the loft early in the evening with
a box of chocolate creams to keep him quiet. Miss
Gwladwyn went on to the stage. The other actors
retired to the improvised green-room, there to continue
their acrimonious disputes and mutual reproaches.
The curtain was slightly drawn. Miss Gwladwyn
went into the aperture and leapt into her pathetic
monologue, and William behind the scenes relapsed
into boredom. He was roused from it by Miss Gwladwyn’s
nephew who came down the steps of the loft
carrying an empty chocolate box and looking green.</p>

<p>“William,” he said, “will you do my thing for me?
I’m going to be sick.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said William distantly. “What do you
do?”</p>

<p>William, not having been chosen as the snow-storm,
had never taken the slightest interest in the snow-storm
scene.</p>

<p>“You just get the bucket in the corridor and take
it up to the loft and empty it over her slowly when
she turns up her face.”</p>

<p>“A’ right,” said William with an air of graciousness,
secretly not sorry to add the snow-storm to his repertoire.
“A’ right. I’ll carry on. Don’ you worry.
You go home an’ be sick.”</p>

<p>It was not William’s fault that someone had put the
stage fireplace in the passage in such a position that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
it completely hid the bucket of torn-up paper and that
the only bucket visible in the passage was the bucket
of water thoughtfully placed there by Mrs. Bruce
Monkton-Bruce in case of fire. William looked about
him, saw what was apparently the only bucket in
the passage, took it up and went to the stairs leading
into the loft. It was jolly heavy. Water! Crumbs!
He hadn’t realised it was water. He’d had an idea
that it was torn-up paper for snow, but probably
they’d changed their minds at the last minute and
thought they’d have rain instead. Or perhaps they’d
only had paper for the rehearsals, and had meant to
have water for the real performance all along. Well,
certainly it <i>was</i> a bit more exciting than paper. He
took it very carefully up the stairs, then knelt over
the little opening where he could see Miss Gwladwyn
down below. He was only just in time. She was
already saying:</p>

<p>“How cold it is! Heaven, wilt thou show me no
pity?”</p>

<p>Then slowly and with a beautiful gesture of despair
she raised her face towards the ceiling to receive full
and square the entire contents of a bucket of water.
William tried conscientiously to do it slowly, but it
was a heavy bucket and he had to empty it all at
once. He considered that he was rather clever in
hitting her face so exactly. For a moment the
audience enjoyed the spectacle of Miss Gwladwyn
sitting on the floor, dripping wet and gasping and
spluttering. Then Mr. Fleuster had the presence
of mind to draw the curtain. After which he
deliberately walked across to the dripping, spluttering,
gasping Miss Gwladwyn and asked her to marry him.
For five years he’d been trying to propose to a dignified
and very correctly dressed and mannered Miss
Gwladwyn, and he’d never had the courage, but as
soon as he saw her gasping, spluttering, dripping on
the floor like that he knew that now was the moment
or never. And Miss Gwladwyn, still gasping,
spluttering, dripping, said, “Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">SLOWLY, WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE OF DESPAIR, MISS
GWLADWYN LOOKED UPWARD AT THE CEILING—TO RECEIVE,
FULL AND SQUARE IN HER FACE, THE CONTENTS OF
WILLIAM’S BUCKET OF WATER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Then the entire cast began to look for William.
Somehow it never occurred to them to blame Miss
Gwladwyn’s guileless nephew. They knew by instinct
who was responsible for the calamity. William,
realising also by instinct that he had made a mistake,
slipped out into the darkness.</p>

<p>He was stopped by a tall form that blocked his
way.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said the tall man. “Going already? I
realised, of course, the last scene must be the <i>grande
finale</i>. I had meant to present this to you at the end,
but pray accept it now.”</p>

<p>He went away chuckling, and William found himself
clasping the most magnificent football he had ever
seen in his life.</p>

<p>And that was not all.</p>

<p>For the next day there arrived a magnificent
cinematograph for the Literary Society, sent by Sir
Giles Hampton with a little note telling them that
their little play had completely cured his nervous
breakdown, that it would be a precious memory to
him all the rest of his life, and that he was going back
to London cheered and invigorated.</p>

<p>And that was not all.</p>

<p>There arrived for William some weeks later a ticket
for a box at a London theatre.</p>

<p>William went, accompanied by his mother.</p>

<p>He came back and told his friends about it.</p>

<p>He said he’d seen a play called <i>Macbeth</i>, but he
didn’t think much of it, and he could have made a
better storm himself.</p>

WILLIAM AND THE ARCHERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WILLIAM and Ginger and Douglas (Henry was
staying with an aunt) were engaged on their usual
Monday morning pastime. A stream ran through the
centre of the village, and flowed under the road at a
point where the village worthies used to collect on fine
Sunday afternoons and evenings to discuss local
affairs, or to stand leaning against the railings gazing
silently in front of them, deep, presumably, in thought,
till bed-time. This little space by the railings was on
Monday morning thickly covered with the matches
with which the village worthies had lit their pipes or
cigarettes. Ginger and William and Douglas carefully
collected the matches. Then Ginger stood at one side
of the road and put the matches into the stream, where
it entered the large pipe which guided it beneath
the road, and William stood at the other side with
a little heap of stones and tried to hit the matches
as they came out. Douglas stood by and acted as
umpire. “Got it!” “Missed it!” he sang out blithely
at intervals. Occasionally the game was held up
by a dispute between William and Douglas as to
whether some particular throw had been a hit or a
miss. After a short time William changed rôles with
Ginger, and Ginger tried to hit the matches as they
came out. Spirited recrimination, insult and counter-insult,
were hurled over the road.</p>

<p>“Fancy not hittin’ <i>that</i> one!” said William.
“Well, I c’n hardly <i>believe</i> you din’t hit <i>that</i> one.
It’s the biggest match I’ve ever seen in all my life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
I don’t see how you could <i>help</i> hittin’ that one. Almost
as big as a rollin’ pin.”</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” said Ginger. “Well, I like that. I’ve
hit <i>hundreds</i> more’n you hit. <i>Thousands.</i> An’ that—why,
it was the <i>teeniest, teeniest</i> match I’ve ever seen.
Not much bigger’n a pin.”</p>

<p>“Well, jus’ fancy not hittin’ that great big, enormous
match. Butter-fingers!”</p>

<p>They met joyfully in the middle of the road and
were only separated by a motor car, which took the
corner at a terrific speed and narrowly missed putting an
end to all further exploits of the Outlaws. They picked
themselves up from the road, their original quarrel
forgotten in a joint fury against the driver of the car.</p>

<p>“Serve him right if he’d killed us,” said Ginger,
“an’ got hung for it.”</p>

<p>“No,” said William. “I bet it’d be more fun for
him not to get hung—but for us to haunt him. I bet
if he’d killed us an’ we’d turned into ghosts, we could
have had awful fun haunting him—— I say”—warming
to his theme—“I bet it would be as much
fun as <i>anythin’</i> we’ve ever done, hauntin’ someone,
groanin’ an’ rattlin’ chains an’ scarin’ ’em an’ jumpin’
out at ’em an’ such like.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he be <i>mad</i>?” chuckled Ginger, “an’ he
cun’t <i>do</i> anything to us ’cause you can’t to a ghost.
When you hit ’em, the hit sort of goes through ’em, an’
if they run after you, an’ catch you, the catch sort of
goes through you, an’ anyway they’re all scared stiff of
jus’ <i>lookin’</i> at you. Won’t it be <i>fun</i> to have everyone
scared stiff of jus’ <i>lookin’</i> at you. I can think,” he
went on meditatively, “of quite a lot of people I’d
like to haunt when I’m dead—Ole Markie an’ Farmer
Jenks an’ people like that. I bet it’d be more <i>fun</i>
bein’ a ghost than <i>anythin’</i>—even a pirate.”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Douglas, “they can’t <i>eat</i>. Jus’
<i>think</i> of not bein’ able to eat. Jus’ <i>think</i> of seein’
sweet shop windows full of sweets an’ being able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
get through doors an’ things so’s you could go into
sweet shops at night when there was no one there
lookin’ after ’em and yet not be able to <i>eat</i>.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you can’t eat,” said Ginger anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Douglas with great solemnity, “I
<i>know</i> you can’t. You put out your hand to take up
a sweet an’ your hand sort of keeps goin’ through ’em
and can’t pick ’em up.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws shuddered at this horrible prospect.</p>

<p>“If you’re a pirate or a robber chief or even a
Red Injun,” went on Douglas, “it’s jus’ as excitin’
an’ you <i>can</i> eat.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws agreed that on the whole it would be
better to be pirates or robber chiefs or Red Indians
than ghosts and returned to the pastime in which the
passage of the motor car had disturbed them.</p>

<p>“Now go on,” William admonished Ginger, “see if
you c’n hit a match what’s almost as big as—a—as
a—as a—telegraph pole,” he said with a burst of
inspiration; “see if——”</p>

<p>Douglas interrupted.</p>

<p>“I’m gettin’ a bit sick of umpirin’,” he said.</p>

<p>“All right,” said William generously. “All right.
You can change places with Ginger an’ Ginger umpire
for a bit an’ you hit—I bet you c’n hit better’n <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>Ginger showed proper spirit in resenting this insult
till the passage of another motor—at a more leisurely
pace—again separated them. The driver leant over
his seat, cursed them soundly and shook his fist at
them. The Outlaws sitting in the dust by the roadside
whither they had rolled on the approach of the
car sat and gazed after it in horror and indignation.
William found his voice first.</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” he said. “Well! <i>fancy</i> nearly <i>killin’</i>
folks an’ then talkin’ like that to ’em. Coo—I’d like
to haunt <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” said Douglas. “Gimme the stones and
start puttin’ the matches in an’ I bet I hit every one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>But it was suddenly discovered that there were only
two matches left and that Ginger and William were
tired of the game. Despite Douglas’ passionate
protests they walked away from the stream, Douglas
remarking bitterly:</p>

<p>“That’s always the way. Always. <i>Always</i> with
<i>everythin’</i>! The minute my turn for anythin’ comes it
stops.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” said Ginger when they had
walked aimlessly to the end of the road.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out the bows and arrers an’ practise,”
said William. “We’ve not done that for quite a long
time.”</p>

<p>So they got out their bows and arrows, fixed up a
target on a tree in William’s back garden and for some
time practised happily enough. Only Douglas was
still gloomy.</p>

<p>“Always the way,” he muttered bitterly as he
listlessly strung his bow. “Umpire for hours an’
hours an’ <i>hours</i> an’ when my time comes only two
matches left.”</p>

<p>“You can have first go hittin’ next Monday,” said
William generously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Douglas, still bitter, “an’ it’ll be wet
Sunday night an’ they’ll all stay indoors an’ there
won’t be any matches. Oh, I <i>know</i>!”</p>

<p>He was further annoyed by the fact that he failed
to score a bull.</p>

<p>“Always the same!” he said, “somethin’ wrong
with my arrers now. ’S’enough for me to get hold
of a thing for everything to go wrong—an’ anyway
it’s a silly sort of thing to do—shootin’ with bows
and arrers. Bow and arrer shootin’ isn’t any use to
anyone but Normans an’ Red Indians an’ such like.”</p>

<p>William who had scored several bulls spiritedly
opposed this view.</p>

<p>“I bet it is,” he said. “I bet it’s more use than
any other sort of shootin’!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Douglas gave vent to his general sense of bitterness
and disappointment by a derisive laugh. “Huh!”
he said, “<i>Huh!</i> D’you mean to say that bow an’
arrer shootin’s more use than <i>gun</i> shootin’ an’ <i>pistol</i>
shootin’? What about the war? Was there any
bow an’ arrer shootin’ in the war? No. They only
did gun shootin’ an’ pistol shootin’ ’cause those is the
only kinds of shootin’ what’s any good. D’you think
that they’d have had only gun shootin’ if bow an’
arrer shootin’ was any good?”</p>

<p>William, having taken up any position, was seldom
at a loss in defending it.</p>

<p>“Huh!” he said repeating Douglas’ derisive laugh,
“<i>Huh!</i> Well, jus’ at first gun shootin’s better, of
course. <i>Anyone</i> knows that. Jus’ at <i>first</i>. Because
they shoot with gunpowder and nat’rally gunpowder
shoots <i>further</i> than string. Yes, but you listen ...
what about when all the gunpowder’s used up? What
about a war what goes on so long that all the gunpowder’s
used up? What’ll they do <i>then</i>? They’ll
<i>have</i> to start shootin’ with bows an’ arrers <i>then</i>. Yes,
an’ they’ll be in a nice mess too ’cause none of ’em’ll
know how to shoot ’em an’ it’s not as easy as it looks.
Yes, they’ll be jolly glad of <i>us</i> to teach ’em <i>then</i>. It’s
jolly lucky for them <i>we</i> know how to do it. I bet
we’ll all be made generals an’ commander-in-chiefs
then. I bet if there’s another war they’ll soon use
up all the gunpowder ’cause with all the lot they used
up in the last war there can’t be much left an’ <i>then
we’ll</i> come in with our bows an’ arrers.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s not many of us to fight against a
whole foreign army,” said Douglas gloomily. “Jus’
you an’ me an’ Ginger an’ Henry against a whole
foreign army.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” admitted William reluctantly. Then he
brightened. “But we could <i>train</i> some more. We
could start trainin’ ’em now so as to be ready.”</p>

<p>It was not in William’s nature, however, to spend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
much time preparing for remote contingencies. He
added hastily, “’S not as if we’d have to wait till we
were grown up. I think that we ought to have a bow
an’ arrer army all ready an’ it doesn’t matter not
bein’ grown up for bows an’ arrers. You can shoot
’em jus’ as hard not grown up. Look at me,” he
swaggered, “two bulls’ eyes straight after each other.
Well, wot I think is this, that we oughter start right
away makin’ a bow an’ arrer army. Wot I think
is”—William was unconsciously lapsing into his
platform manner—“that people aren’t as careful as
what they ought to be about foreign armies landin’.
There’s nothin’ to stop ’em. They can jus’ get into a
ship an’ sail over to England an’ land same as anyone
else an’ here’ll they be right in the middle of us before
we know anythin’ about it. Wot I say is that we
oughter <i>do</i> somethin’ now ’stead of waitin’ an’ waitin’
an’ <i>waitin’</i> till it’s too late. Wot I say is that we might
wake up to-morrow an’ find the fields here full of
foreign enemies what have sailed over in the night
an’ think what a long time it’d take to get our soldiers
together an’ to get gunpowder for their guns. Before
they’d have time to do that the foreign enemy’d
have conquered ’em. Well, wot I say is that if <i>we’re</i>
here with an army of bow and arrer shooters it’ll be
all right. Bows an’ arrers don’t need a lot of gettin’
ready like guns—— If they break you can easy
make another, an’ we can go on usin’ ’em long after
they’ve used up all their gunpowder an’ got nothin’
left to shoot with. Well, wot I say is”—William,
worked up for an oratorical climax, sought about in
his mind for some striking and original remark and
finding none repeated—“Wot I say is we’ve gotta get
a bow an’ arrer army.”</p>

<p>Ginger and Douglas, carried away by this flow of
eloquence, cheered loudly.</p>

<p>William collected his “bow an’ arrer army” with
surprising speed. The holidays were drawing to a close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and most of his school friends and acquaintances were
growing tired of their own resources and were willing
to follow William wherever he led them. Some of
them already possessed bows and arrows. Others
bought them. Others made them. William assembled
them on the first day on which they were fully equipped
and harangued them.</p>

<p>“Soldiers,” he said, “we’ve all gotter learn bow
and arrer shootin’ so as to be ready for when all the
gunpowder in the world gets finished up which, of
course, it must do sometime, same as coal, we’ve
gotter be ready for when a foreign enemy comes
suddenly over in ships by night an’ is here right in
the middle of England before anyone finds out.
They’d be disguised, of course, till they started fightin’.
Well, we’ve gotter be ready with our bows and arrers
to fight ’em an’ hold ’em at bay till the real army’s
got together, an’ got its guns an’ gunpowder an’
things, an’ then we’ve gotter be ready to fight ’em
again when all the gunpowder’s used up. That’s
what we’ve gotter do, we’ve gotter be <i>ready</i>,” William
as ever was at this point fired by his own eloquence,
“we’ve gotter be ready to save our country from
the enemy, same as people like Moses an’ Napoleon
did....”</p>

<p>“Napoleon din’t,” said a small child in the rear.</p>

<p>“Moses din’t neither,” said another.</p>

<p>“Oh, they din’t, din’t they?” said William
threateningly, annoyed at the interruption.</p>

<p>They looked at William. William after all was
more real than Moses and Napoleon. It didn’t matter
what Moses and Napoleon had done. It did matter
what William might do.</p>

<p>“All right then,” they agreed pacifically, “they did
then.”</p>

<p>“Course they did,” said William, “an’ that’s what
we’ve gotter do. Save the country from the foreign
enemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>His faithful band waved their bows and arrows and
cheered enthusiastically.</p>

<p>At first all went well. The Bow and Arrow Army
practised diligently under William’s leadership. They
set up a target on a tree, stood in a long line one
behind another, and as each came to the front on the
word of command from William shot at the target,
while the result was noted on a slate by Ginger. So
far so good. But the archers with the perversity of
human nature soon began to grow tired of it. They
weren’t content to stand in a row, step forward at
William’s word of command, shoot, and have the
result noted on a slate by Ginger. It was all right
just at first, but after an hour or so it became boring.
True, the small boy who had challenged the historical
truth of William’s reference to Napoleon introduced a
diversion by shooting William calmly and deliberately
by a well aimed arrow in the middle of his stomach
and running off, leaving William writhing in agony
on the ground. William, however, quickly recovered
and was on the point of furiously pursuing his assailant
when he was held back by Ginger who pointed out,
truly enough, that if William were to leave them the
bored archers would probably straggle off to other
diversions. So William, ever an opportunist, turned
the incident to account. He made another speech.</p>

<p>“Soldiers,” he said. “You can jus’ see from me
being nearly killed then, what a deadly weapon a
bow’n arrer is. That’s what you’ve gotter do to the
foreign enemies of the country, hit them in the stomach
nearly killin’ ’em like what John Francis did me.
And,” he ended simply, “when I catch John Francis
I’ll jolly well <i>show</i> him.”</p>

<p>The archers, because cheering is a change from
shooting at a target, cheered.</p>

<p>But the fact remained that the archers were growing
bored. They preferred William as leader of lawless
expeditions to William as Commander-in-Chief of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
disciplined band of archers. Shooting at a target
is thrilling enough for the first day, becomes less
thrilling on the second and is boring in the extreme
on the third. None of them dared to vary the
monotony as had John Francis by shooting William.
John Francis, it transpired, had acted thus quite
safely in the knowledge that he was going away the
next day on a fortnight’s visit to an aunt, and it was
a known fact that no insult ever lived in William’s
memory for longer than a week. William’s life was
too full to admit of his cherishing vengeance against
anyone for longer than a week.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The scarecrows were William’s idea. It was indeed
such an idea as could have been no one’s but William’s.
William realised that his band of warriors was growing
daily more listless and discontented, that it was held
together solely by the hope—daily diminishing—that
something exciting really was going to happen soon,
and they only did not desert in a body because they
were afraid of finding afterward that they had missed
an adventure.</p>

<p>So William thought of the scarecrows.</p>

<p>He realised that a target lacked human interest
and he realised that in almost every neighbouring
field stood a fairly lifelike scarecrow which might
well serve to represent the foreign enemy to whose
destruction he had so often urged his gallant band.
Moreover all the fields were “trespass fields,” and
between William and the neighbouring farmers there
waged a deadly feud which would lend to the expedition
that element of lawlessness and adventure without
which William as well as the archer band was feeling
the whole thing to be rather flat.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this the archer band brightened
perceptibly and set off behind their leader lovingly
fingering their bows and chanting joyous songs of
battle. The adventure did not disappoint them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
They had a glorious day, a day that glowed brightly
in their memories for many months. They surrounded
every scarecrow in every field and shot at it
with bow and arrow till it collapsed realistically and
blood-curdlingly into a heap on the ground. When
the result did not take place quickly enough, they
hastened it by a few discreetly placed stones. A
scarecrow, as an enemy, possesses the supreme advantage
(to its assailant) of not being able to do anything
back. From two or three of the fields they were chased
by irate farmers which gave the game the piquant edge
of excitement they had all hoped for.</p>

<p>William would have liked his men to shoot at the
farmer enemy as they retreated but even he had to
admit that this was more difficult than it sounds. He
tried it, hit Ginger by mistake and fell over a ploughed
furrow at the same time. William had never heard of
the Parthians but if he had, would have had a deep,
deep respect for them. They retired, however, fleetly
and in good order, leaving none of their number in the
hands of the enemy who finally gave up the chase,
and purple-faced with breathlessness and fury, contented
themselves with standing and shaking their fists
at them till they were out of sight. It was altogether
a glorious and thrilling day. But William realised with
something of apprehension that it could not be
repeated indefinitely. It was doubtful even whether
it could be repeated once. The scarecrows were
completely demolished and if new ones were set up
it was pretty certain that they would be closely
guarded. No, the band must not expect a day like
this every day. They must be content with routine
work for some time after this—with drilling and
shooting at targets. Before they disbanded William
delivered one of his stirring speeches.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve seen to-day,” he said, “what we can do
to a foreign enemy if one lands an’ comes right into
the middle of England. We can knock ’em to pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
same as we did the scarecrows,” he ignored the
convenient passivity of the scarecrow enemy which
had assured the victory, and continued, “an’ then if
they start runnin’ after us we can get out of their way
same as we did out of Farmer Jenks’ an’ Farmer
Hodges’, and then when they’re too tired to run any
more, we can shoot at ’em again same as we could have
done at Farmer Jenks an’ Farmer Hodges if it hadn’t
been tea-time. An’—an’ now we’ve gotter go on
practising quietly for a bit so’s to be ready, ’cause—’cause
we never know when we’ll wake up one mornin’
an’ find all the fields full of foreign enemies what have
come over in the night.”</p>

<p>The band of archers, inspirited by the events of the
day, cheered enthusiastically.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next morning William woke early and looked
out of the window. His eyes opened wider and wider
and wider. He rubbed them and looked again. It
was true. The fields near the house were full of
soldiers and tents. He dressed himself in a state
of stupefied amazement. It had really happened.
A foreign enemy had really crossed over in the night
and had entrenched itself in the fields about his home.
William descended to breakfast still feeling dazed.</p>

<p>“I say,” he said, “there’s soldiers. All over the
field.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be the manœuvres,” said his sister Ethel
casually.</p>

<p>“How do you <i>know</i> it’s the mou—what you said?”
said William sternly. Ethel looked at him.</p>

<p>“There’d be a fortune,” she said, “for anyone who
would invent a hairbrush that would make a boy’s
hair look tidy.”</p>

<p>“But they’d never use it even if anyone did,” said
William’s mother gloomily.</p>

<p>William snorted and sat down before his porridge
plate. That was just like his family. A foreign enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
only a few yards away and all they could talk about
was his hair. Probably when the foreign enemy started
shooting at them and killing them they’d still be going
on at him about his hair or his face or something.
Nothing—nothing—could ever stop them. Bitterly
William wondered whether such people were worth
saving.</p>

<p>After a hasty breakfast he hurried out to his archer
band. He found them mildly excited.</p>

<p>“But they’re English soldiers,” said one with a
certain disappointment in his voice. “I’ve heard ’em
talkin’ English.”</p>

<p>“<i>Course</i> they talk English, silly,” said William
crushingly, “but that doesn’t <i>prove</i> they’re English.
<i>Course</i> they taught ’em English before they brought
’em over. Do you think they’d bring ’em over talking
foreign langwidges an’ arousin’ everyone’s suspicions?
<i>Course not.</i> <i>Course</i> they c’n talk English. I bet they
saw you listening an’ started talkin’ English jus’ so’s
not to arouse your suspicions.” William had come
across this phrase in a Secret Service story the night
before and was proud of having an opportunity of
using it, “But you go’n listen to them when they don’t
think anyone’s listenin’ an’ I <i>bet</i> you’ll find ’em talkin’
foreign langwidges.”</p>

<p>Obviously the majority of the Archer band was impressed
by this. But one small doubting warrior piped
up:</p>

<p>“Well, when I told my father this mornin’ that I’d
seen ’em, he said, ‘Oh, yes. It’ll be the manooverers’—or
something like that—‘an’ I don’t suppose they’ll
be here more than a day or two.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William excitedly, “that’s <i>jus’</i> it.
That’s jus’ what they <i>knew</i> people’d say. They come
here dressed like English soldiers an’ talkin’ English
so as not to arouse suspicion and they know that the
English people’ll jus’ take for granted that they’re
English till they start fightin’ ’em and then it’ll be too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
late. English people are like that. They look out
of their windows an’ see a lot of soldiers in English
clothes talkin’ the English langwidge an’ they say,
‘Oh, yes, it’ll be the—the—mooverers’—same as what
George’s father said, an’ Ethel said, and they start
talkin’ about my hair jus’ as if they weren’t goin’ to
be killed the next minute.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” piped up a small archer in
the background.</p>

<p>“What does what mean?” said William to gain time.</p>

<p>“That word you said—Mooverers.”</p>

<p>William cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s a French word meanin’ English Soldier,”
he said. His stern eye wandered among his Archers
daring any of them to deny it. No one did deny it
because everyone believed it implicitly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s wot I say,” went on William relieved,
“they knew that when English people saw they were
dressed like English soldiers an’ talkin’ the English
langwidge they’d say, ‘Oh, they’re jus’ mooverers,’ an’
not do anythin’ to stop ’em. They’ll stay here till
they’ve learnt all about the country, then they’ll conquer
the village an’ then they’ll go on an’ conquer all
the rest of England. But—we’ve—gotter <i>stop</i> ’em.”</p>

<p>The Archers waved their bows and arrows and
cheered enthusiastically. This was better than
practising at a target. This was better even than
shooting scarecrows.</p>

<p>“Let’s go now,” said William and added cautiously,
“jus’ to have a look at ’em first. We mus’ make plans
careful before we start fightin’ ’em.”</p>

<p>The band of Archers marched joyously down the
road still cheering and waving bows and arrows.</p>

<p>At the gate of the large field they stopped and gazed
at the scene. There were small tents and big tents,
and everywhere soldiers were hurrying to and fro or
standing talking in groups.</p>

<p>“There’s some officers in that tent,” said William,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
“an’ I bet if you went up to it you’d find ’em talkin’
foreign langwidges.”</p>

<p>“Well, go up to it an’ see,” challenged Ginger.</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” said William promptly accepting
the challenge.</p>

<p>Watched in a thrilled silence by his Archers he went
further down the road till he was just behind the tent,
then he wriggled through the hedge. William had
through long experience brought wriggling through
hedges to a fine art. Then he crawled up to the tent
and daringly lifted it an inch or so, placing his ear to
the aperture. Inside were two young officers. The
first had just said:</p>

<p>“I saw the old man coming out of the ‘Blue
Boar’ this morning.” And just as William lifted
the flap and applied his ear to it, the other was
replying:</p>

<p>“<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</i>”</p>

<p>William replaced the flap, crawled back to the hedge,
and wriggled through to the road.</p>

<p>“They were talkin’ foreign langwidges,” he said
excitedly, “foreign langwidges wot I couldn’t understand
a word of——”</p>

<p>The Archers cheered loudly. So stimulated were
they by the prospect of adventure, that they would
have been bitterly disappointed had William brought
back any other report.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve gotta make <i>plans</i>,” said William,
assuming a stern and thoughtful demeanour.</p>

<p>“’Sno good <i>rushin’</i> at ’em, straight away. There’s
more of them than what there is of us. We’ve found
out—<i>I’ve</i> found out, I mean—that they’re a foreign
enemy. Well, we’ve gotter save the country from
’em. That’s what we’ve gotter do. But it’s no good
<i>rushin’</i> at ’em before we’ve made plans. We’ve
gotta make <i>plans</i> first. An’ we’ve gotter be <i>cunnin’</i>
as well as brave ’cause there’s so many more of them
than what there is of us. We’ve gotter find out first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
who’s the head of ’em an’ we’ve gotter do it without—without
arousin’ their suspicions.”</p>

<p>The Archers cheered again lustily.</p>

<p>They would have cheered William now whatever
he had said. The longed-for adventure had come.
They were willing to trust themselves blindly and
joyously to William’s sole leadership. Ginger felt that
William was having rather more than his fair share of
the limelight.</p>

<p>“I’ll find out who’s the head of ’em,” he offered.
“I bet it’s a dang’rous thing to do but I bet I do it
all right.”</p>

<p>The Archers cheered Ginger.</p>

<p>“I bet it’s no more dang’rous than seein’ if they
were talkin’ in foreign langwidges,” challenged
William.</p>

<p>Ginger’s proud spirit had been assuaged by the
Archers’ cheers. He felt that he could afford to be
generous.</p>

<p>“No, it’s just about the same,” he conceded.</p>

<p>He wriggled through the hole which had been left
in the hedge by the passage of William’s solid body
and began to creep very cautiously along the tents,
peeping under each to see their interior. At one he
evidently made a discovery of a sensational nature.
He turned round, made excited but incomprehensible
signs to the Outlaws who were watching over the
hedge, then began to crawl back. He plunged through
the hole and began at once.</p>

<p>“I’ve found the head of ’em. He’s a big fat man
with a red face an’ a white moustache an’ he’s sittin’
at a table lookin’ at a map.”</p>

<p>“Well, that <i>proves</i> it,” said William equally excited,
“that <i>proves</i> it. If he wasn’t foreign he wun’t need
to be lookin’ at a map, would he? If he was really
English like what they pretend to be he wun’t need
to be lookin’ at a map of England. He’d’ve done
England at school in Geography.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>

<p>The Archers agreed that the logic of this was unassailable.</p>

</figure>

<p>William continued:</p>

<p>“Well, now that’s the first thing we’ve gotter do.
We’ve gotter take his map off him. I said it was
no use <i>rushin’</i> at ’em an’ we’d gotter be cunnin’.
Well, that’s the first cunnin’ thing we’ve gotter do.
We’ve gotter take his map off him an’ then you see he
won’t know what to do or where he is or anythin’.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ginger hastily, “I’ve done enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
findin’ out about who he is. I’m not goin’ to take his
map off him.”</p>

<p>“No,” said William; “it’s time Douglas did something.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_079">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE ARCHERS, CROUCHING IN THE DITCH, LOOKED ON,
HORROR-STRICKEN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Archers cheered this.</p>

<p>It was well known that Douglas did not care to
expose himself unnecessarily to danger. But Douglas
received the suggestion with stoic courage. Despite his
preference for a quiet life, Douglas was no coward.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said resignedly, “jus’ tell me how
to do it, an’ I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>But the discussion was interrupted by the sight
of the big fat man with the red face and white
moustache emerging from his tent, map in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“There he is!” hissed Ginger. “Din’ I <i>tell</i> you?
Map’n all!”</p>

<p>With eyes starting out of their heads the Archers
watched the progress of the red-faced warrior as he
came slowly down the field, his eyes still fixed on the
map outspread in his hands.</p>

<p>“Wonder what he’s thinkin’ about,” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“Whatever he’s thinkin’ about,” said William
knowingly, “I bet he’s thinkin’ about it in a foreign
langwidge.”</p>

<p>The fat, red-faced man was coming to the gate of
the field. His eyes still fixed on the map, he came out
into the road.</p>

<p>The Archers, looking round for a hiding-place, saw
none but the ditch into which they hastily precipitated
themselves. The man came slowly down the road,
still looking at the map. He passed the Archers
crouching in the ditch. The sight of the enemy thus
within his grasp was too much for William. Without
waiting to consider or reason William acted.</p>

<p>General Bastow, walking peaceably down the road
studying his map as he went, was amazed to see a
boy suddenly scramble up out of the ditch by the roadside.
A moment later he was still more amazed to
receive the full force of the boy’s bullet-head in his
stomach, and to be forced by its sheer iron weight
into a sitting posture in the dust. For a moment
physical agony blinded him to everything but the outrage
committed by that dastardly boy upon his digestive
organs. Then his vision cleared. He found his map
gone and a boy disappearing on the horizon. It was
not General Bastow’s habit to receive any outrage
sitting down (except as in this case inadvertently).
With a roar of fury he set off in pursuit, less in order
to recover his map (of which he had other copies) than
in order to inflict condign punishment upon the person
of his assailant. But it was not for nothing that
William was pursued regularly and unavailingly by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
all the local farmers. William’s life had perforce been
largely spent in throwing off pursuers. When General
Bastow, plum-coloured and panting, had reached the
cross-roads, there was no sign of William anywhere.
It seemed futile to continue the pursuit, so the elderly
warrior, panting and rumbling like a threatening
volcano, returned slowly back along the road to the
gate, which led into the field, and back into his tent.
When he had finally disappeared, still rumbling
furiously, into his tent, the Archers scrambled out of
the ditch in an awestruck silence and went towards
the cross-roads where William had vanished.</p>

<p>There they saw William emerging, jaunty and
unshaken, from behind a hayrick in a neighbouring
field, carrying the map. He joined them on the
road.</p>

<p>“Well,” he chuckled, “<i>now</i> they’ll be in a nice fix.
They jolly well won’t know what to do without the
map. They won’t know where they are or anythin’.
I say”—with a reminiscent chuckle—“din’t he go
down with a flop?” Then with his own inimitable
swagger: “My head’s jolly strong. I bet there’s jolly
well no one I can’t knock over with my head.”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do next?” said Ginger joyfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, jus’ watch ’em for a bit,” said William, “they
won’t know what to do without their map.”</p>

<p>Next day every movement of the innocent company
of territorials was interpreted by William as one of
utter bewilderment and despair.</p>

<p>“Look at ’em, marchin’ down there, cause that’s
where they saw me go off with the map an’ they’re
tryin’ to find it. They dunno what to do without it.
Look at that one goin’ into the village. He’s goin’
to try’n buy another map an’ he won’t be able to
’cause they don’t keep ’em. Look at that one postin’
a letter. He’s writin’ off to the foreign country they
come from to tell ’em that they’ve had the map took
and to ask ’em what to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>The great discovery was when he found a company
of them digging a trench, at the end of the field.</p>

<p>“Look at ’em. They’re givin’ up tryin’ to conquer
England now they’ve had their map took off them
an’ they daren’t go home by ship, same as they came,
because they know now that someone knows about
’em with getting their map stole—so look at ’em. I
bet they live at the other side of the world an’ they’re
tryin’ to dig themselves through back to their homes,
you know, ’cause of the world bein’ round like what
they say it is in geography.”</p>

<p>The Archers were so pleased with his idea that they
cheered again lustily. Its only drawback was that few
of them had really in their hearts ever subscribed to
the theory that the earth is round. As Douglas said—when
they began now to discuss the idea afresh:</p>

<p>“Stands to reason, dun’t it, that folks can’t walk
about upside down like flies. They’d drop off the
earth altogether. Even if they tried holdin’ on by trees
an’ things they’d be sure to drop off in the end. Ships
couldn’t stay in the sea either. They’d drop out.”</p>

<p>“And the sea cun’t stay there neither,” said Ginger,
elaborating the theme. “You can’t have water stayin’
in a place upside down without anythin’ to keep it in.
It’d spill out.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’re we goin’ to do about this foreign
army?” said an Archer who was not interested in the
problematical shape of the earth.</p>

<p>“Jus’ wait an’ watch ’em for a bit still,” said William.
“We’ve got their map. They can’t do anythin’ without
their map.”</p>

<p>But by the end of the next day both William and
his Archers had tired of waiting and watching.</p>

<p>They felt that the time was ripe for some decisive
coup, and so they met in William’s back garden to
decide what form exactly the coup should take.
William led the discussion.</p>

<p>“I votes,” he said, “that we get the general man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
away from them somehow. Then when we attack
them they’ll have no one to tell’m what to do. They’ll
be without a leader an’ we’ll easy be able to put ’em
to flight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but <i>how</i>’ll we get the ole general away from
them?” demanded the Archers.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll talk about that now,” said William.</p>

<p>So they talked about that.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next evening was the last evening of the
manœuvres and there was a relaxed atmosphere
about the camp. General Bastow set off to dine
with an acquaintance who lived at the further end
of the village, though the General wasn’t quite sure
where, as he’d never visited him before at home.
Dusk was falling as he walked along the road. He had
been terribly bored by the manœuvres and he still
hadn’t forgotten that brutal attack perpetrated upon
him in broad daylight by that dastardly young ruffian.
He was certain that his liver had never been the same
since. He still had hopes of meeting that young
ruffian face to face. He’d never come across a place
with so many boys in it. Crowds of boys seemed to
have been watching the camp ever since they settled
there, peeping over the hedge, following men and
officers about. He was rather short-sighted, and he
hadn’t had time to look for that young ruffian again,
but he’d know him if he saw him. He turned a corner
of the road and suddenly came across a small boy
crying bitterly. It was the youngest Archer, but the
General, of course, could not know this, nor could
the General know that the whole body of Archers
was concealed in the muddy ditch, watching the
encounter. The General did not like small boys, but
he felt that he could not pass by a small boy in such
deep distress without some offer of assistance.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” he bellowed irritably, “what’s
the matter with you, my little man?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I’m lo—o—o—o—ost!” sobbed his little man.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! nonsense!” boomed the General.
“Nonsense! We’ll soon find your home for you!”</p>

<p>“T—thank you,” sobbed his little man, slipping his
hand confidingly in his. “T—thank you.”</p>

<p>The General had not quite bargained for this. He
had not meant to spend his evening finding a home
for a lost boy, but fate seemed to have thrust the
situation upon him.</p>

<p>“Where do you think you live, my little man?” he
said testily.</p>

<p>“D—down this road, I think,” sobbed his little man.</p>

<p>In the gathering dusk he led his rescuer down the
road.</p>

<p>“Will you recognise the house when you see it?”
said the General.</p>

<p>“Y—yes, I think so,” sobbed the youngest Archer.</p>

<p>“Well, stop crying, my good child, stop crying.
Try to be a man. Crying won’t do any good.”</p>

<p>The youngest Archer stopped crying. He was glad
to be told to stop crying. It is quite easy to sob
convincingly for a minute or two but difficult to
continue it indefinitely. He was afraid that his
performance was beginning to lack realism. At each
house along the road the General said, “Do you
think you live here, my little man?” and his little
man said with a break in his voice of which he was
secretly proud, “No—no. N—not here.” Till they
got to the large house at the end of the road, then,
when the General said, “Do you live here, my little
man?” the youngest Archer said, brightly, “Why,
yes, I think—I <i>think</i> it’s here.”</p>

<p>They entered the wrought iron gates together, and
walked half-way up the drive. Then the youngest
Archer gently withdrew his hand and disappeared in
the dusk. The General stood gazing around, his eyes
and mouth wide open. The child had vanished as
completely as if the earth had opened to swallow him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
up. Behind him he heard a clang of metal as the iron
gates swung to. As he was standing there, amazed and
indecisive, the front door opened and a voice said:</p>

<p>“That you, General?”</p>

<p>With relief the General recognised the voice of the
friend with whom he was going to dine.</p>

<p>“Found your way to the house all right?” went on
the friend.</p>

<p>“Well, a curious chance led me here,” said the
General, “as a matter of fact, I’d no idea it was your
house till you spoke. A little boy who said he was
lost—but he was probably playing a trick on me, the
young ruffian. All boys are the same. Why, only the
other day on the main road in broad daylight——”</p>

<p>Talking volubly he entered the hall with his host
who shut the front door behind him.</p>

<p>When the General and the realistically sobbing
youngest Archer had turned the bend of the road, the
main body of Archers with their bows and arrows
climbed out of the ditch and clustered round William.</p>

<p>“Well,” said William, “I mus’ say he did that jolly
well—<i>jolly</i> well—— Now let’s sep’rate. Ginger an’
Douglas and half of you go after them an’ me ’n’ the
others’ll go back an’ charge the soldiers an’ with him
not bein’ there they won’t know what to do, an’ they’ll
have no one to lead ’em. Come on!”</p>

<p>With a flourish he led his half army away and Ginger
and his little band set off cautiously down the road in
the wake of the General and the youngest Archer.</p>

<p>Soon they saw the youngest Archer come out of the
gates, shut them behind him, and run excitedly down
the road to meet them.</p>

<p>“I’ve shut him in,” he said in a shrill whisper, “he’s
in all right.”</p>

<p>They approached the iron gate and clustered around
it, watching and listening. All was as still and silent
as it had been when the youngest Archer left it. He
could not know, of course, that he had led the General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to his host nor that in that brief interval during which
he ran to greet and report to his friends, the General
had been received and admitted by the master of the
house. They gazed and listened. All was still—all
was silent—and it was growing dark.</p>

<p>“He’s creepin’ about the garden, I bet,” said the
youngest Archer, “tryin’ to find a way out—— Look,
I believe I c’n see him. Over there.”</p>

<p>The more imaginative of the Archers said that they
thought they could see him too.</p>

<p>“Well, half of us’ll stay here guardin’ this gate,”
said Ginger, “an’ shoot him if he tries to come out,
an’ half go round to the back gate, an’ guard that
an’ shoot him if he tries to come out. He won’t <i>dare</i>
to try’n take refuge in the house, ’cause it’s Mr.
Hunter’s, an he’s a magistrate an’ he’d know at once
that he was a foreign enemy an’ put him in prison.
He’ll either stay hidin’ in the garden or else try’n’
get out of this gate when we’ll shoot him or else try’n’
get out of the other gate when the others’ll shoot him.”</p>

<p>The others had already gone round to the side gate.
Ginger and his little band pressed their noses against
the wrought iron and gazed intently into the garden.</p>

<p>It was a windy night and black shadows moved
with the swaying trees.</p>

<p>“Look, there he is,” Ginger would say, “crouchin’
down there! Look! He moved! D’you see!”</p>

<p>The Archers saw. With every minute that passed
their imaginations grew keener and there was not one
of them who did not distinctly see the dark shadow
of General Bastow, creeping round the corners of the
house and beneath the trees.</p>

<p>“He’s gettin’ desperater an’ desperater,” said
Ginger, “he daren’t go in ’cause he knows it’s a
magistrate livin’ there, an’ he daren’t come out ’cause
he knows we’re waitin’ to shoot him, an’ he’s jus’
creepin’ about gettin’ desperater an’ desperater.”</p>

<p>It happened that in Mr. Hunter’s garden was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
pond much frequented by frogs. Suddenly through
the night air came the sound of a frog’s croak—then
another—then another.</p>

<p>“Listen to him moanin’ an’ groanin’,” interpreted
Ginger, “gettin’ desperater an’ desperater.”</p>

<p>There came the sound of a splash as a frog jumped
into the pond and then silence.</p>

<p>“He’s drowned himself,” said Ginger in an awestruck
voice. “He’s got desperater an’ desperater
till he’s drowned himself.”</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>“He must have,” said Ginger. “I don’t see him
creepin’ about anywhere now, do you?”</p>

<p>The Archers didn’t.</p>

<p>“Let’s go’n’ look,” said a specially bold one.</p>

<p>They opened the gate cautiously and crept up the
drive past the house to the pond. It was perhaps as
well that they could not see through the dining-room
blind the figure of their supposed victim sitting at a
table, stout and red-faced as ever, eating and drinking
heartily.</p>

<p>They clustered round the pond. Dark shadows lay
at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>“I can see his dead body,” said Ginger, “can’t
you? Over there. Under that tree. Right at the
bottom.”</p>

<p>The more imaginative Archers said that they could
see his dead body quite plainly. The less imaginative
ones said that they thought they could.</p>

<p>“Well, we’d better go,” said Ginger. “Now he’s
drowned hisself there’s no use stayin’ here keepin’
guard. Let’s get over the side gate an’ go’n’ help
William.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile William and his band had walked back
to the field where the “foreign enemy” was still
entrenched. Just behind the trench was the high wall
which bounded a garden belonging to Miss Milton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
an inveterate enemy of William’s. But—fortunately
for William—Miss Milton was away on her holiday
and a caretaker occupied the house. William had
little fear or respect for caretakers. He knew by long
experience that they spent most of their time sleeping,
were generally deaf and short-sighted and always
short-winded. Heartened by this thought he collected
and addressed his followers.</p>

<p>“<i>Now’s</i> the time for us to attack ’em,” he said
flourishing his bow and arrows in a warlike manner.
“<i>Now’s</i> the time, while they haven’t got their leader
to tell ’em what to do. We’ll go into Miss Milton’s
garden—careful, ’cause the old woman mightn’t be
asleep, but anyway she’s sure to be deaf so it’ll be all
right. We’ll climb up behind the wall an’ lean over
an’ attack ’em with the bow an’ arrers an’ I bet you—I
jolly well bet you <i>anythin’</i> you like that we put
’em to flight.”</p>

<p>The Archers cheered in shrill excitement and marched
off gaily in their leader’s wake. William knew the
best hole through the hedge into Miss Milton’s garden.
William knew the best holes through the hedges into
most of his neighbours’ gardens. This was not
unnatural as most of them had been made by the
frequent furtive passage of William’s body. The
other Archers followed less nimbly being less accustomed
than their leader to such means of entrance.
In the garden William stood and looked about him.
All was silent and empty. There was not even a
serpent in the garden in the shape of a gardener.
And the windows at the back of the house were
reassuringly blank. No suspicious caretaker’s face
was visible at any of them. William heaved a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“<i>That’s</i> all right,” he said to his army. “Now
come along—<i>creep</i>—to the bottom where the wall is.”</p>

<p>They crept to the bottom of the garden, William
creeping at their head. They imitated faithfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
William’s manner of creeping, but none of them
approached William’s creeping form. William was
justly proud of his creeping. Not for nothing had he
practised being a Red Indian and a robber chief and
a cinema villain painstakingly and for many years.
He had brought creeping to a fine art. The finest
villain on the cinema stage might have learnt something
from William’s creeping. It was not perhaps a very
unobtrusive mode of procedure but it was dramatic.
He suited his expression to his walk and assumed an
air of furtive cunning. So wrapt up was he in fulfilling
his rôle of creeper to his own satisfaction that
it was not till he reached the bottom of the garden
that he realised that the wall was too high for them
and that they could not possibly see over it, much
less launch an attack from the top of it. The other
Archers were taken aback, but William assumed his
stern frown of leadership.</p>

<p>“We’ll jus’ have to get somethin’ to stand on,” he
hissed in a dramatic whisper.</p>

<p>A small Archer attempted a cheer but was muffled
and cuffed by an older one.</p>

<p>So they set about finding something to stand on.
Under William’s direction, and still creeping with
melodramatic furtiveness to and fro, they fetched a
table from a summer-house and put upon it a row of
large plant pots upside down. As this did not hold
them all, others moved forward a cucumber frame,
stood it up sideways and balanced plant plots upon it.
Then laboriously and, miraculously, without accident,
they mounted the precarious erection and peeped
cautiously over the top of the wall. Yes, the soldiers
were still in the trench below them.</p>

<p>“Get your bows an’ arrers ready,” hissed William.</p>

<p>They got them ready as best they could, holding
on to the wall with one hand while the erection of
table and cucumber frame and plant pots rocked
beneath them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“One, two, three—<i>fire!</i>” said William.</p>

<p>They fired.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_090">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“ONE, TWO, THREE—<i>FIRE!</i>” SAID WILLIAM. THEY FIRED.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is one thing to stand on firm ground and take
careful aim at a target affixed to a tree near you and
quite another to shoot over the top of a wall on to
which you have to hold with your chin while an
unsteady erection of plant pots and cucumber frame
rocks beneath you. Most of the arrows went rather
wild. But it happened that as the <i>grande finale</i> of
the manœuvres the soldiers were practising an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
“over the top” charge out of the trench and across
the field, and just as William’s band shot their arrows
the officer gave the signal to charge. The soldiers
swarmed up out of the trench and began to rush
across the field.</p>

<p>“We’ve put ’em to flight,” roared William
triumphantly, “we’ve p——”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_091">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE SOLDIERS SWARMED UP OUT OF THE TRENCH AND
BEGAN TO RUSH ACROSS THE FIELD.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But at this point the whole erection of plant pots,
table and cucumber frame collapsed with a terrific
clatter of breaking glass and pots. Shaken and
apprehensive the Archers picked themselves up from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the débris. Their apprehensions were not unfounded
for immediately the kitchen door burst open and
caretaker and gardener rushed out in avenging fury.
The Archers, leaving their weapons ignominiously
behind in the enemies’ territory, scrambled precipitately
through the hedge and were not a moment too
soon. In fact the gardener seized the foot of the last
Archer, who, with great presence of mind, wriggled
his foot out of his shoe and, leaving his shoe in the
gardener’s hand, fled after the others down the road
pursued by the shoe which the gardener flung after
them, and which hit William neatly on the head.
William was just about to throw it back and see if he
could hit the gardener equally neatly on the head when
its owner, who had been trying to invent a plausible
explanation of its absence for his mother, snatched it
from William’s hand and put it on as he ran. The
Archers did not dare to go down the road again towards
the field where the irate gardener and caretaker
presumably awaited them. So they marched down
the road where they had left Ginger and his band,
chanting pæans of victory. It was almost dark when
they met Ginger and his band. They also were
coming down the road chanting pæans of victory.</p>

<p>“We put ’em to flight,” yelled William as soon as
he caught sight of his friend.</p>

<p>“He’s drowned hisself,” yelled Ginger joyously.
They met and began excitedly to exchange
reports.</p>

<p>“We just fired once,” said William, “an’——”</p>

<p>“We shut the gate on him,” said Ginger, “an’——”</p>

<p>“They went dashin’ out of their hole terrified
an’——”</p>

<p>“He went moanin’ an’ groanin’ about the
garden——”</p>

<p>“Simply <i>terrified</i>——”</p>

<p>“Gettin’ desperater an’ desperater.”</p>

<p>“An’ went tearin’ away over the field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“An’ at last went an’ drowned himself in a
pond....”</p>

<p>“We saw ’em <i>tearin’</i> away over the field.”</p>

<p>“We heard a big splash and then saw his dead
body in the pond an’——”</p>

<p>The Archers would have liked to have gone back to
the field to see whether there were any traces of the
routed enemy, but the thought of the caretaker and
gardener, who probably still lay in wait for them with
hostile intent, deterred them.</p>

<p>“We’d better not go back,” said William, “they
may’ve left bombs or—or snipers or somethin’, but,”
he ended impressively, “I can jolly well tell you that
there won’t be <i>one</i> of ’em left to-morrow mornin’.
They’ll all go back home in their ships to-night.”</p>

<p>And William was right in the first part of his
prophecy. There was not one of them left in the
morning. They had, as originally arranged, departed
with praiseworthy dispatch and smartness in the early
hours of the morning.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was the next week and they were in William’s
back garden. William was still discussing the affair.
The other Outlaws were beginning to get rather bored
with the airs William put on about it. William seemed
not to have stopped talking about it since it happened,
and his boasting grew more unbearable every day.</p>

<p>“I oughter have a statchoo put up to me,” he said.
“I did it. It was all my idea. I’ve saved the country
an’ conquered a foreign enemy an’ I oughter have a
statchoo put up to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Ginger, “so ought I too, anyway,
an’ anyway I’m jolly well tired of it an’ let’s go
fishin’ again.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said William, taking up the stick
which bore a bent pin attached to it by a length of
damp string. “All right. I don’t mind. But wot
I say is that I ought to have a statchoo put up to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
for savin’ the country. Yes, you ought to, too,” he
concluded hastily as Ginger began to speak, “you
ought to, too, but I oughter have the biggest one
because it was my idea anyway. I oughter be put
up on a tall piller like Nelson. I ought——”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and stood as if petrified, his
eyes staring in horror and amazement at a figure
which was just coming in at the front gate.</p>

<p>General Bastow had returned after the manœuvres
to spend a few days with his friend, Mr. Hunter, had
met Mr. Brown there and had to-day been invited
to the Browns’ to lunch. William did not know this.
Ginger and Douglas were equally petrified. The three
of them stood transfixed with horror—eyes and mouths
open wide. The visitor strode jauntily up to the
front door. He did not see the three boys who were
crouching behind the bushes.</p>

<p>William recovered from his stupor first. He turned
to Ginger and hissed:</p>

<p>“Thought you said he’d drowned himself ...
thought you said you’d seen his dead body.”</p>

<p>Ginger’s face was pale with horror.</p>

<p>“I did,” he gasped, “I did honest. This must be
his ghost.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be,” said Douglas. “You can’t see
through it.”</p>

<p>“You c-can’t always see through them,” said
Ginger faintly.</p>

<p>“Dun’t <i>look</i> like a ghost,” said William grimly.</p>

<p>“It <i>mus’</i> be,” said Ginger recovering gradually his
normal manner. “It mus’ be. I tell you I <i>sor</i> his
dead body in the pond. He’s haunting us ’cause we
made him kill himself same as you said you’d haunt
the man what nearly killed you with a motor car. I
bet you <i>anythin’</i> that if you went up an’ gave him a
good hit the hit’d go right through him.”</p>

<p>General Bastow had reached the front door and
rung the bell. He stood there twirling his white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
moustaches still unaware of the three boys behind
him.</p>

<p>“All right,” said William, “go’n do it. Go’n give
him a good hit and see if it goes through him.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” said Ginger unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Ginger had been so convinced that the black shadow
at the bottom of the pond was General Bastow’s dead
body that he had no doubt at all that this apparition
was General Bastow’s ghost come back to haunt him.
He had decided to show it once for all that he was not
afraid of it. <i>He</i> would jolly well teach it to come
haunting <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>Before either William or Douglas could stop him
he had crept up behind the gallant warrior and dealt
him a sound punch in the small of his back. The
General started round, purple-faced and snorting
with anger. The impact of his fist with the solid
flesh of the General had convinced Ginger at once
that this was no ghostly visitant from another world,
and panic-stricken he had darted off into the bushes
like a flash of lightning. Douglas, with admirable
presence of mind, had followed him, and when the
General turned, purple-faced and snorting, only
William was there standing behind him, rooted to
the spot in sheer horror. And at that moment
William’s father opened the door. The General
pointed a fierce finger at William.</p>

<p>“Th-a-t boy’s just hit me,” he spluttered, going a
still more terrific purple.</p>

<p>At this monstrous accusation the power of speech
returned to William.</p>

<p>“I d-didn’t,” he gasped, “Ginger did. Ginger hit
you b-because he thought you were a ghost.”</p>

<p>The enormous figure of the General seemed to grow
more enormous still and his purple face more purple
still. His eyes were bulging.</p>

<p>“Thought I was a g—— Thought I was a <i>what</i>?”</p>

<p>“A ghost,” said William.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“A GHOST?” roared the General.</p>

<p>“Yes, a ghost,” said William; “he thought he’d
drowned you and you’d come back to haunt him.”</p>

<p>“He thought—WHAT?” bellowed the General.</p>

<p>“He thought he’d drowned you and you’d come
back to haunt him. He was hitting you to see if the
hit would go through you.”</p>

<p>The General stared at him and stared and stared.
And a memory came back to him—a memory of a
dusty road, a bullet-head in his stomach and an
unavailing pursuit. He looked as if he were going
to have an apoplectic fit. He pointed a trembling
finger at William.</p>

<p>“Why—<i>you’re</i> the boy,” he sputtered, “who——”</p>

<p>William’s father intervened quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “Come and tell me what he did
indoors.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was evening. William and Ginger and Douglas
sat gloomily in William’s back garden.</p>

<p>“That’s all one gets,” said William bitterly, “for
savin’ one’s country. That’s all one gets for puttin’
a foreign enemy to flight. Bein’ treated like that.
Oh, no, no one believes me, do they? Oh, no. They’ll
believe any lies any foreign enemy tells them, won’t
they? but not me, not me what’s saved the country.
They won’t believe anythin’ I say. Oh, no. I can
save the country from a foreign enemy, but <i>that</i>
doesn’t make any difference. Oh, no. They won’t
listen to a word I say. Oh, no. But they’ll listen to
a foreign enemy all right. Oh, yes. Well, I’ve jolly
well finished with ’em and <i>now—now</i>”—impressively
he brought out his terrible threat—“if they came to
me on their knees <i>beggin’</i> to put up a statchoo to me,
I wouldn’t let ’em.”</p>

WILLIAM—THE MONEY MAKER</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Outlaws stood around and gazed expectantly
at William.</p>

<p>“Well, where’re we goin’ to get ’em?” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“Buy ’em,” said William after a moment’s deep
thought.</p>

<p>There was another silence. The solution was felt to
be unworthy of William.</p>

<p>“<i>Buy</i> ’em!” echoed Douglas in a tone that expressed
the general feeling, “<i>buy</i> ’em! Who’s got any money?”</p>

<p>This question being unanswerable remained unanswered.
It was a strange fact that the Outlaws
never had any money. They all received pocket
money regularly and they all received the usual
tips from visiting relatives, but the fact remained that
they never had any money. Most of it, of course,
went in repairing the wreckage that followed in the
train of their normal activities—broken windows,
shattered greenhouse frames, ruined paintwork and
ornaments which seemed to the Outlaws deliberately
to commit self-destruction on their approach. As
William frequently remarked with deep bitterness:</p>

<p>“Meanness, that’s what it is. Meanness. Anythin’
to keep the money themselves ’stead of givin’ it to us.
Seems to me they go about makin’ things easy to break
so’s they c’n have an excuse for keeping it themselves
instead of givin’ it us. <i>Meanness.</i> That’s what it is.”</p>

<p>The parents of the Outlaws who formed a sort
of unofficial Parents’ Union and generally worked in
concert had evolved the system of fines—one penny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
for being late to a meal, a halfpenny for dirty hands
at meals and a farthing for not scraping their boots
before coming into the house (merely wiping them was
insufficient. The Outlaws always brought in with
them the larger part of the surrounding countryside).
What was salvaged from the general wreckage of their
finances caused by this ruthless tyranny seldom passed
the test of the close proximity of Mr. Moss’ sweet shop
with its bottles of alluring sweets and its boxes of less
lasting but more intriguing chocolate “fancies.”</p>

<p>“<i>Buy</i> ’em,” echoed Henry with deep feeling.
“What’re we to buy ’em with? There’s <i>laws</i> to stop
people takin’ money off other people, but my father”—with
heavy sarcasm—“don’t seem to have heard of
’em. He’ll be gettin’ into trouble one of these days
takin’ other people’s money off them. He’s startin’
with me, what he thinks can’t do anythin’ back, but
he’ll be goin’ on to other people soon like what the
Vicar said people always do what begin pickin’ an’
stealin’ in little things an’ then he’ll be gettin’ into
trouble. Takin’ sixpence off me jus’ for bein’ late
for a few meals! An’ then they keep sayin’ why don’t
we <i>save</i>. Well, what <i>I</i> say is why don’ they give us
somethin’ to <i>save</i>, ’fore they start goin’ on an’ on at
us for not savin’. Not that I b’lieve in savin’,” he
added hastily, “I don’ b’lieve in savin’ an’ I never
have b’lieved in savin’. Money isn’t doin’ any good
to anyone—not while you’re savin’ it. I think it’s
<i>wrong</i> to save money. Money doesn’t do any good
to you or to anyone else. Not while you’re savin’ it.
It’s kinder to help the poor shop people by spendin’
money at their shops. How’re the poor people in
shops goin’ to live if all the people save their money
an’ don’t spend any of it?... Well, anyway that’s
what <i>I</i> think.”</p>

<p>This was for Henry an unusually long and an unusually
eloquent speech. It showed that he had
been stirred to the depth of his feelings. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
a moment’s impressed silence. Then the others
murmured in sympathy and Douglas said: “Let’s
go’n look at ’em again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They were in the window of the little general shop
at the other end of the village.... Three of them,
beautiful in shape and strength and size and symmetry,
with brass tops—cricket stumps. They were priced
eight and sixpence.</p>

<p>“Golly!” said Ginger wistfully. “Just think of
<i>playin’</i> with ’em!”</p>

<p>“You <i>can</i> get ’em cheaper than that,” suggested
Douglas tentatively, “you can get ’em for three and
six. Smaller, of course, and not so nice.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws, who were flattening their noses against
the glass and gazing at the stumps like so many
Moseses gazing at the Promised Land, treated Douglas’
suggestion with contempt.</p>

<p>“Who’d want to play with cheap ones after seeing
these ones?” said William sternly. “There’s no <i>sense</i>
in talkin’ about <i>cheap</i> ones now we’ve seen these ones.
I—I’d sooner go on playin’ with the tree than play
with <i>other</i> ones now we’ve seen these ones.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws had these holidays developed a passion
for cricket. They had, of course, partaken in the
pastime in previous years, but listlessly and with
boredom as in a pastime organised by the school
authorities and therefore devoid of either sense or
interest. Fielding had, of course, provided ample
opportunity for studying the smaller fauna which
infested the cricket pitch (last term Ginger had several
times been hit squarely in the back while engaged
in catching grasshoppers at mid-on), and batting was
usually of short duration, but not until these holidays
had the Outlaws regarded cricket as a game to be
played for its own sake when not under the eye of
Authority. The discovery was a thrilling one. The
Outlaws in this as in everything threw moderation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
to the winds. They played cricket in season and
out of season. They began the game before breakfast
and continued it throughout the day with intervals for
meals. They considered cricket far more enlivening
when played with four players than when played with
twenty-two. Ginger’s elder brother gave them an old
ball and Douglas had had a bat for a birthday present.
Stumps they did not worry about. They chalked
stumps on a tree trunk and played quite happily
with them for a long time. But they found that
stumps chalked on a tree trunk have their drawbacks,
of which the chief one is that the bowler and batter
are seldom agreed as to when one is hit. The Outlaws
generally settled the question by single combat
between batter and bowler, which at first was all
right because the Outlaws always enjoyed single combats,
but as the game itself became more and more
exciting the perpetual abandoning of it to settle the
score by single combat became monotonous and rather
boring.</p>

<p>It was then that the Outlaws decided to procure
stumps. Had they not happened to see the eight and
six set all would have been well. They would have
stuck sticks into the ground or scraped together
enough money to buy an inferior set at one and eleven.
But—not now. Now that they had seen the eight and
six set of stumps, the set of stumps <i>de luxe</i>, the set of
stumps with brass tops from the Land of the Ideal,
they knew that all the savour would be gone from the
game till they possessed them.</p>

<p>“Eight and six,” said Douglas gloomily. “Well, we
shall never get eight and six, so we may as well stop
thinking of them, and just do the best we can with
sticks.”</p>

<p>This spiritless attitude irritated William.</p>

<p>“<i>Why</i> can’t we get eight an’ six?” he said. “Of
course we c’n get eight an’ six if we want it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” challenged Douglas, as irritated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
William’s attitude as William had been by his. “If
you c’n get eight an’ six, go an’ <i>get</i> eight an’ six.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” said William.</p>

<p>He hadn’t exactly meant to say this, but the words
were out so he accompanied them with a careless
swagger.</p>

<p>They eyed him morosely and yet with a gleam of
hope.</p>

<p>“Course you can’t get eight an’ six,” they said.
“How c’n you get eight an’ six?”</p>

<p>William having taken up a position, however rashly,
was not going to abandon it.</p>

<p>“P’raps <i>you</i> can’t,” he said kindly. “I daresay
<i>you</i> can’t, but if <i>I</i> want to get eight an’ six I bet I c’n
get eight an’ six.”</p>

<p>“Before to-night?” said Ginger. “You’ll bring
’em here to-night?”</p>

<p>William was for a second taken aback by thus
having the soaring flights of his fancy tied down to
time and space.</p>

<p>He blinked for a moment, then recovering his
swagger said:</p>

<p>“Course. You wait and see.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He walked home rather thoughtfully. Eight and
six. The magnitude of the sum staggered his
imagination. How could he get one and six or even
sixpence, let alone eight and six? Not for the first
time he regretted those rash impulses that always
seemed to visit him at critical moments and make
him undertake quite impossible tasks. The actual
undertaking was, of course, a glorious moment—the
careless swagger, the impression he gave himself as
well as his audience of hidden resources, secret powers—almost
of omnipotence.</p>

<p>But afterwards—and <i>eight and six</i>! William felt as
helpless as if he had undertaken to provide a million
pounds. He did not remember ever possessing as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
much money as eight and six. He did not remember
ever knowing anyone who possessed as much money
as eight and six. And yet—he knew that his prestige
was at stake. With simple, touching faith the Outlaws
were now looking to him to provide eight and six
before to-night.</p>

<p>Up till now William had, owing to strokes of pure
luck, always managed to make good his spectacular
promises of the impossible, but this time he thought
that he had met his Sedan. He did not think it in
those exact words, of course, because he had not yet
got to Napoleon. He was still laboriously and uninspiredly
doing the Wars of the Roses. But he did
think that he was in a beastly hole and he’d look a nice
fool when he met them to-night with only the twopence-halfpenny
which he might be able to extort from the boy
next door, in exchange for a set of cigarette-cards. (The
boy next door never had more than twopence-halfpenny,
and as he did not collect cigarette-cards the
exchange would have to be forcibly effected.) Looking
round all his available resources, William did not see
any prospect of anything except that possible twopence-halfpenny.
His family, of course, was out of the
question. His brother and sister always pretended
that they had no money which, as William knew, was
absurd, considering that they were grown up and had
magnificent allowances and nothing to spend them
on. It seemed to William one of the many ironies
of fate that when you were young—say eleven—and
had a lot of interesting things to buy, such as cricket
bats and sweets and pistols and airguns and mouth-organs,
you had only a measly twopence a week,
and when you were old—say eighteen like this brother—and
had lost your taste for interesting things, they
gave you shillings and shillings which you simply
went and wasted on things like clothes and notepaper
and suitcases and books (to quote a few recent instances
of waste of money which William had noticed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the adult members of his family). It always made
him feel bitter to see perfectly good money which
might have been spent on cricket bats and sweets and
pistols and airguns and mouth-organs squandered
on such things as clothes and notepaper and suitcases
and books. His sister had particularly disgusted
him only the other week by buying an expensive
book of music. How much better and kinder it
would have been, thought William, to buy the cricket
stumps for him....</p>

<p>His mother? His mother was softer hearted than
any other member of his family (which in William’s
opinion was not saying much), but only yesterday
he had inadvertently spilt boiling sealing-wax on the
top of her polished writing-table while carrying on—without
her knowledge—some private and highly
interesting experiments with a sealing-wax set which
she had won as a prize at a bridge drive. The set
consisted of little balls of sealing-wax and a tiny
saucepan in which to heat them over a little candle,
and as soon as William saw it he knew that his spirit
would have no rest till he had tried it. As he explained
to her when she discovered the damage, he did not
know that it was going to boil over on to her table
like that.... He had made things worse by trying
to get the mark out with ammonia because he had seen
his mother the night before getting a stain out of his
suit with ammonia.</p>

<p>His mother had covered up the mark by the simple
expedient of putting the ink pot upon it and had agreed
to say nothing about it to William’s father, but William
felt it was hardly a propitious moment for approaching
her with a request for eight and sixpence....</p>

<p>His father? ... he hadn’t yet paid for the landing
window and his father was presumably still feeling
annoyed about the cricket ball which had accidentally
hit him yesterday evening when William was practising
bowling in the garden. No: it would be little short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
of suicidal to approach his father for eight and six
to-day and quite hopeless at any time. Extraordinary
to think of the hundreds of pounds which must be
wasted on quite useless things every year and no one
would give him eight and six for a really necessary
thing like cricket stumps....</p>

<p>He wandered gloomily homeward. A youth with
projecting teeth met him and gave him an expansive
smile of greeting. William replied with his darkest
scowl. He recognised the youth as Ethel’s latest
admirer and one of the most unsatisfactory admirers
Ethel had ever had. He had given the youth every
chance to buy his good graces, and the youth had
not presented him with so much as a cigarette card.
William, who did not believe in wasting efforts, had
long since ceased to greet the youth with any attempt
at pleasantness. Pleasantness to Ethel’s admirers was
in William’s eyes a marketable quality and this youth
had not seen fit to purchase it.</p>

<p>After turning to watch the youth out of sight and
wasting upon the youth’s unconscious back an
exceptionally expressive grimace of scorn and ridicule,
William continued gloomily to plod his homeward way.</p>

<p>On arriving home he first went up to his bedroom
and carried out a systematic search of all his drawers
and pockets. William was an incurable optimist
and always hoped to find some day a forgotten coin
in a pocket or a corner of a drawer. Ginger had once
found a halfpenny in the pocket of a flannel suit he
had not worn since the summer before, and ever after
that all the other Outlaws had lived in hopes of doing
the same thing. The search, however, proved in this
case fruitless. It revealed only a rusty button and
an old whistle which must have lost some vital part,
for though William, temporarily forgetting the eight
and six, expended a vast amount of wind and energy
on it no sound of any sort resulted. Thereupon,
purple in the face and breathless, he threw it indignantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
out of the window. It seemed to him a typical
example of fate’s way of dealing with him. Even when
he found an old whistle it hadn’t any blow in it....</p>

<p>Scowling bitterly and still trying to devise some
method by which one might conjure eight and sixpence
out of the void he descended to the garden.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the garden he found his sister Ethel wearing a
neat land girl’s costume and weeding a bed. The
Browns were temporarily without a gardener, and
Ethel had undertaken the care of the garden till a
new one should be engaged. She had done this chiefly
because she had discovered how extremely fascinating
she looked in a land girl’s outfit. The land girl’s
outfit was partly responsible for the fatuous smile
on the projecting teeth of the youth who had just
left her....</p>

<p>William watched her for a minute in silence. His
thoughts were still bitter. Spending money on that
old gardening suit that might have been used to buy
the stumps.... His eye roved round the garden....
Spending money on spades and rakes and watering
cans and seeds and flowers and things that didn’t do any
good to anyone ... things that must have cost ever
so many eight and sixes, and they wouldn’t give him
one little eight and six to buy a useful thing like cricket
stumps.</p>

<p>Suddenly an inspiration visited him.</p>

<p>“Can I help you, Ethel?” he said with an ingratiating
smile.</p>

<p>She looked up at him suspiciously, began a curt
refusal, then stopped. She was growing tired of
gardening. She was growing tired of her land girl’s
outfit. Its novelty had worn off and it was rather
hot and stuffy. The youth with projecting teeth
admired her in it intensely, but then she was growing
tired of the youth with projecting teeth. She stood
up and stretched.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“CAN I HELP YOU, ETHEL?” WILLIAM SAID, WITH AN
INGRATIATING SMILE. ETHEL LOOKED UP AT HIM
SUSPICIOUSLY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“How much do you want for it?” she demanded
brusquely.</p>

<p>She laboured under no delusions as to the disinterestedness
of William’s offers of help. She had
known William too long for that.</p>

<p>“Sixpence an hour,” said William daringly.</p>

<p>He never thought she’d give it him. But Ethel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
was sick of kneeling on the ground in the hot sun in
a suit of clothes she was beginning to dislike, slaving
for a lot of silly plants which didn’t seem to look any
better when she’d done with them.</p>

<p>“All right,” she said.</p>

<p>William did a hasty sum. Eight and six. Two
sixpences in a shilling. Twice eight are sixteen and the
other sixpence seventeen. Seventeen hours. <i>Crumbs!</i></p>

<p>“I meant a shilling,” he said quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, you said sixpence and sixpence is all you’ll
get,” said Ethel, unfeelingly.</p>

<p>William was not surprised. He hadn’t really hoped
for anything else from Ethel. Well, it would be a
beginning ... and perhaps when he’d got this bit
of money something else would turn up.</p>

<p>“What d’you want me to do?” he said.</p>

<p>“Water the rose beds with the hose pipe and weed
the bed on the lawn and pick a basket of strawberries
for mother. <i>Pick</i>, not eat, remember.”</p>

<p>William haughtily ignored the insult contained in
the last sentence and mentally contemplated his
directions with a professional air.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last, “that’ll take me a good
many hours. I daresay that’ll take me all the rest
of to-day, late into the night an’ most of to-morrow.”
He was struggling in his head with vast and complicated
mental sums ... hours into sixpences—sixpences
into shillings.... She interrupted them.</p>

<p>“It oughtn’t to take you more than two,” she said.
“Anyway I’m not paying you for more than two. It
oughtn’t really to take you one.”</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” said William in a tone of surprise and
indignation, as if he was unable to believe his ears.
“<i>Well!</i>”</p>

<p>But Ethel was already out of earshot. She was
going to change the land girl’s outfit (which she had
finally decided was not really her style at all) for a
dress of printed chiffon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>William stood and stared around the garden
despondently. What was one shilling in eight and
six? Then his ever ready optimism came to his aid.
One shilling was better than nothing.... He
might as well start on it. What had she said first?
The hose pipe.... Well, it wouldn’t be so bad.
Quite apart from the shilling the hose pipe always
had its bright side.... Normally William was
forbidden the use of the hose pipe. Even Ethel
wouldn’t have told him to use the hose pipe if she
hadn’t been in a state of weary disgust with gardening
in general and her land girl’s suit in particular. William
fitted on the hose pipe nozzle and turned on the tap.
He had no thought in his mind except the watering of
the rose beds as directed, and the earning of his shilling.</p>

<p>It was sheer bad luck that just at the critical moment
when he was about to deluge the rose bed he suddenly
caught sight of his inveterate enemy, the next-door
cat, silhouetted against the sky on the top of the wall.
William did not stop to reason. He acted on the
overpowering impulse of the moment. He turned
the full flow of the hose pipe on to the person of his
enemy. His enemy nimbly evaded it and it flowed
in a pellucid unbroken fountain over the wall into
the next garden. There came a shrill scream.</p>

<p>“The brute! He’s soaked me!” a voice shrilled.</p>

<p>“Me too!” screamed another. “Oh, the brute!
Who was it? I’m soaked.”</p>

<p>“It must be that awful boy next door.”</p>

<p>“Look over the wall and see if you can see him.
Stand on the chair!”</p>

<p>After a few minutes’ interval an irate and dripping
head appeared over the wall and looked around for
William. It did not see William, however. William,
crouching behind the rain tub, was quite hidden from
view. It saw, however, the hose pipe flung upon the
ground and discharging its full force down the garden
path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“It’s him,” said the voice. “I don’t see him but I
know it’s him. He’s left the thing there. Look!
Pouring out. It must be him.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go straight in to change and then go and tell
his father. I’m still soaked.”</p>

<p>The head disappeared; the sound of indignant
voices grew fainter; a distant door closed.</p>

<p>William emerged from behind the rain butt and
hastened to turn off the tap and put away the hose
pipe.... All that beastly cat’s fault. Now he came
to think of it hose pipes always had been unlucky
for him. There’d been that little affair at the doctor’s
only a few months ago....</p>

<p>Well, he’d better get on with the rest of it and try
and get the shilling safely before they were dry enough
to come and see his father. What had she told him
to do next? Weed the bed on the lawn. William
promptly knelt down and weeded the bed on the lawn
with commendable thoroughness. There was no doubt
at all in William’s mind as to what constituted a weed.
In William’s mind a weed was any plant he did not
know the name of. William knew the names of very
few plants. When he had finished weeding the
bed contained a few straggling stocks and asters and
one marguerite. By his side lay a pile of uprooted
lobelias, petunias, calceolarias, veronicas and other
plants. He carried these carefully to the rubbish
heap, then gazed with pride at the bed on which he
had been working.</p>

<p>“Looks a bit tidier now,” he said.</p>

<p>Only one more thing to do. What was that? Oh,
a basket of strawberries. He got a basket from the
greenhouse and proceeded to the strawberry bed. He
sat down there and a languorous content stole over
him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Ethel appeared dressed in the printed chiffon.
She looked very dainty and bewitching. She’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
decided to send the land girl’s suit to the next parish
jumble sale—it really wasn’t her style.... William
ought to have finished now. She’d give him his
shilling and then she’d tell her father that she’d done
what she’d said she’d do in the garden and she jolly
well wouldn’t offer to do any more. Anyway, a new
gardener would be coming next week.... She
suddenly stopped motionless, her eyes wide open in
horrified amazement. The rose bed was still unwatered,
but the garden path was completely swamped.
Her eyes wandered slowly to the bed on the lawn
which she had told William to weed. It was as
William had left it—completely denuded except
for half a dozen straggling plants whose presence
only emphasised its desolation. There was no sign
of William. Ethel went round to the kitchen garden.
William was sitting on the path by the strawberry
bed still in a state of languorous content. Ethel stared
from the empty basket to the empty strawberry bed
and from the empty strawberry bed to William’s
gently moving mouth.</p>

<p>“You <i>naughty</i> boy!” said Ethel. “You’ve <i>eaten</i>
them, every one!”</p>

<p>William awoke with a start from his state of languorous
content and looked at the basket and the strawberry
bed. He was almost as amazed and horrified
as Ethel.</p>

<p>“I say,” he said. “I din’t meant to eat ’em <i>all</i>.
I din’t honest. I only meant to try jus’ one or two
jus’ to make sure they was all right before I started
pickin’ ’em. I—I expect really it’s the birds that did
it when they saw I wasn’t lookin’. <i>Honest</i>, I don’t
think I could’ve eaten ’em all—I’m sure I only ate just
a few—jus’ to see they was all right.”</p>

<p>Ethel’s fury burst forth.</p>

<p>“I shan’t give you any money and I shall tell father
the <i>minute</i> he comes in.”</p>

<p>This reminded William of something else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“I say, Ethel,” he said anxiously. “No one’s—no
one’s been in to see father jus’ lately, have they?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” snapped Ethel. “Why?”</p>

<p>“No, nothin’,” said William. “I mean I jus’
thought p’raps someone might be jus’ sort of comin’
to see him, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Ethel turned on her heel and walked away. Slightly
to relieve his feelings William put out his tongue at
her back. He might have known Ethel would let
him slave for her for all this time and then not give
him a penny. It was just like Ethel. He’d known
her all his life and he might have known she’d play
him a mean trick like that. Getting him to work
like a nigger and promising him a shilling and then
not giving him a penny jus’ because—well jus’ because
of hardly anything.</p>

<p>A great despondency possessed William. He seemed
to be farther off the eight and six than ever....
Ethel being Ethel would not be likely to forget to tell
his father and presumably the recipients of the contents
of the hose pipe were already drying themselves in
preparation for their visit.... He was in for a
rotten time. He wouldn’t have minded if he’d got
the eight and six. He wouldn’t mind anything if
he’d got the eight and six. He decided that it would
be as well to leave the strawberry bed, so after carefully
wiping his mouth to remove any chance stains, he
wandered disconsolately round to the front of the
house. His mother was coming out of the front door,
dressed in her best clothes.</p>

<p>It struck Mrs. Brown that her younger son was
looking rather pathetic. She was short-sighted and
she often mistook William’s expression of fury and
disgust for one of pathos. It was a mistake which
had often served William well.</p>

<p>“Would you like to come with me, dear?” she said
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Where to?” said William guardedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“To a nice little Sale of Work in Miss Milton’s
garden,” said his mother. “I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.”</p>

<p>William was sure he wouldn’t, but it occurred to
him that he might as well be at Miss Milton’s nice
little Sale of Work as anywhere. Better than staying
at home where his father and the next-door neighbours
might arrive any minute.</p>

<p>“A’ right,” said William graciously. “I don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“Very well, dear. I’ll wait for you. Go and wash
and brush yourself.”</p>

<p>“I have washed and brushed myself,” said William.
“I did it specially well this morning to last the day.”</p>

<p>“Well, it hasn’t done, dear,” said Mrs. Brown
simply. “So go and do it again.”</p>

<p>With a deep, deep sigh expressive of bitterness and
disillusion and unexampled patience under unexampled
wrongs, William went to do it again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first person he saw at the Sale of Work was
Ethel in the printed chiffon accompanied by the
young man with projecting teeth. William, who had
detached himself from his mother, passed them without
acknowledging them and hoped that they felt small.
As a matter of fact they had not noticed him. He
wandered about the garden. It might have been a
more or less enjoyable affair for there were bran tubs
and coco-nut shies and Aunt Sallies on a small scale—had
William not been weighed down by his heavy
financial anxieties. He was obsessed by the thought
of the eight and six.</p>

<p>There simply didn’t seem any way in the world of
getting eight and six....</p>

<p>He found his mother and assuming that expression
that he found so useful in his dealings with her said:</p>

<p>“Mother, please may I have a little money to spend
here?”</p>

<p>His mother was obviously touched by his tone and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
expression, but after a brief inward struggle seemed
to conquer her weaker feelings.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, William dear, because you know
what your father said about the landing window last
week. But I’ll give you just one penny, because it’s
all in a good cause and I’m sure your father didn’t
mean when it was a case of charity. But not more
than one penny.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Brown gave him a penny which he pocketed
carefully as the nucleus of the eight and six.</p>

<p>Then he began to wander disconsolately round the
grounds again. A small tent bearing the legend
“Crystal Gazer” attracted his attention. He looked
at it with interest for some time, then turned to a
bystander.</p>

<p>“What’s a Crystal Gazer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A sort of fortune teller,” answered the bystander
absently.</p>

<p>A sort of fortune teller ... perhaps a fortune teller
might tell him how to get eight and six.... William
went off to find his mother. She was serving at a
stall. He assumed his pathetic expression and wistful
voice again.</p>

<p>“Mother, please,” he said. “May I have my
crystal gazed?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Brown was busy and the effect of William’s
pathetic expression and wistful voice was beginning to
wear off.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” she said very firmly. “I don’t believe
in it. I think it very wrong to meddle with the future.”</p>

<p>William walked back to the tent deeply interested.
The fact that his mother considered it wrong invested
it with a sort of glamour in his eyes, and “meddling
with the future” sounded vaguely exciting. The
tent was not opened yet, but was due to open in ten
minutes. Already a queue of prospective clients
was lined up before the doorway. William wandered
round to the back of the tent. He had forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
even the eight and six in a consuming curiosity about
the crystal gazing. The back of the tent was quite
deserted. Cautiously William descended to his hands
and knees, held up the canvas and peeped underneath.
Inside the tent was the young man with projecting
teeth and a girl whom William recognised as the
young man’s sister. The young man was just giving
her a paper.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_114">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_114.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">WILLIAM LAY ON THE GROUND AND LISTENED.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“She doesn’t know you’re going to do it, does she?”
the young man was saying.</p>

<p>“No. And I shall be wearing this veil. It quite
hides my face.”</p>

<p>“Well, just say to her what’s on this paper, will
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“All right.” The girl put the paper on the table
and said, “Now do get out. I’ve got to start.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_115">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“I SEE SOMEONE,” THE CRYSTAL GAZER SAID IMPRESSIVELY
“WHOSE LIFE IS CLOSELY BOUND UP WITH YOURS.”<br>
<br>
“WHO IS HE?” SAID ETHEL, WITH INTEREST.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The young man got out and after a few minutes
the queue began to enter one by one. William lay
on the ground and listened beneath the canvas flap.
He found it rather dull. When it was a girl the crystal
gazer saw either a dark man or a fair man in the crystal
and when it was a man the crystal gazer saw either a
dark girl or a fair girl in the crystal....</p>

<p>It was so dull that William was just going to abandon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
his post of eavesdropping when Ethel entered. He
saw the crystal gazer move the paper on her table,
concealed from Ethel by a book, so that she could
read it.</p>

<p>“I see someone,” she read impressively from the
paper, “whose life is closely bound up with yours.
At present you do not appreciate him. You are harsh
and cold to him. But he has great qualities which you
have not yet discovered. He is a far nobler character
than you think.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” said Ethel with interest.</p>

<p>“I will show you how to tell who he is,” said the
crystal gazer. “I can see him here. He is giving
you a present. I can even see the time. It is just
five minutes after you leave this tent. I see him again.
He is sitting next to you at tea. I see him again.
He is meeting you on your way home. He asks you
a question. Let me tell you that the happiness of
your whole life depends upon your saying ‘yes.’
That is all I have to tell.”</p>

<p>Looking deeply impressed Ethel left the tent by the
front.</p>

<p>Looking equally impressed William left the tent by
the back.</p>

<p>It was exactly five minutes after Ethel left the tent
when William, carrying a penny bag of monkey nuts,
met the young man carrying a five-shilling bunch of
roses and wearing a fatuous smile.</p>

<p>“You lookin’ for Ethel?” said William.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“She’s right over the other end by the gate,” said
William.</p>

<p>The young man hastened off towards the gate.</p>

<p>William went to his mother’s stall where Ethel was
helping and handed her the bag of monkey nuts.</p>

<p>“Here’s a little present for you, Ethel,” he said.</p>

<p>Suspiciously Ethel opened it. Ordinarily she would
have accepted it either as a deliberate insult or as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
feeble attempt to buy her silence about the hose pipe
and the strawberries. But she looked at the clock.
It was just five minutes after her departure from the
crystal gazer’s tent....</p>

<p>She threw a bewildered glance at William’s expressionless
face and received the bag with a confused
murmur. It was certainly curious, a present just
five minutes after leaving the tent ... someone she
didn’t appreciate. The young man did not find her
till ten minutes afterwards and she was still puzzling
so deeply over her mysterious present from William at
the exact minute foretold by the crystal gazer that
she hardly noticed the roses at all—merely murmured
“thanks” and put them on the side table and went
on thinking about William presenting her with a
bag of monkey nuts at the exact minute foretold by
the crystal gazer.</p>

<p>The young man was on the look-out when Ethel
and Mrs. Brown went to the tea tent. He accompanied
them, walking on the other side of Ethel, talking,
and smiling amicably. William walked behind. They
entered the tea tent. They approached the row of
chairs. They began to sit down on three chairs,
Mrs. Brown at one end, Ethel in the middle and—it
wasn’t till the young man was in the act of sitting
down that he saw that William was on the seat.
William was sitting between Ethel and him. Ethel
was staring at William in amazement. William was
gazing in front of him unperturbed and sphinx-like,
as though in a trance. The young man asked William
to change places with him. William refused. He said
that he’d better sit there so that he could pass things
to his sister and his mother and Mrs. Brown said that
that was very nice of him, and thought how William’s
manners were improving, and that she must remember
to tell his father.</p>

<p>Ethel was very silent. She continued to gaze at
William with mingled amazement and bewilderment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and anxiety. The fortune teller had said “he”—William
had given her a present and here he was
sitting next to her at tea—most curious. She was so
silent that the young man finally gave up all attempts
to entertain her and contented himself with glaring
balefully at William. William continued to gaze
blankly in front of him as if unaware of their presence
and to make a very good tea.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>People were going home now. Mrs. Brown was
staying to help dismantle the stalls but Ethel had
set off home by herself. She was going the short cut
home across the fields. She climbed over a stile.
She saw the young man at the other end of the field
standing by the further stile obviously waiting for
her. She walked demurely and daintily towards him.
Then suddenly as if he had sprung up from a ditch
(which as a matter of fact he had) William appeared.</p>

<p>“Please, Ethel,” he said meekly, “will you give me
eight and six?”</p>

<p>She stared at him open-mouthed with amazement
at the request—the cheek of it! And then her
thoughts travelled suddenly back to the crystal
gazer ... “meet on your way home” ... “request”
... “happiness of your whole life depends upon your
saying yes.”</p>

<p>Ethel was superstitious. Dreadful things might
happen to her if she refused and yet—<i>eight and six</i>.
Still—no, she daren’t refuse. <i>Anything</i> might happen
to her if she refused.... Furiously she opened her
purse ... <i>eight and six</i>—it would only leave her a
pound till the end of the month.</p>

<p>Angrily she flung the coins at William and walked
on. She felt so angry that when she reached the
young man at the further stile she walked straight
past him without looking at him or answering him
when he spoke to her....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Mr. Brown sat in his chair in the drawing-room
holding his head. On one side of him was Ethel and
on the other side the ladies from next door. Ethel
was feeling especially bitter at the thought of the
eight and six. She had long ago repented of giving it
to William. She’d never go to a crystal gazer again.
She’d been an absolute idiot. It was all rubbish
... making her give William eight and six.... She
felt she could almost kill William. But as she couldn’t
do that she contented herself with expatiating on his
horticultural failures.</p>

<p>“He hadn’t <i>touched</i> the bed with it,” she was saying.</p>

<p>“It <i>deluged</i> us,” said the ladies from next door.</p>

<p>“He’d pulled up <i>everything</i>,” said Ethel.</p>

<p>“Came over in a perfect fountain and <i>deluged</i> us,”
said the ladies next door.</p>

<p>“And he simply ate every one—every single one in
the bed,” said Ethel, “there wasn’t <i>one</i> left.”</p>

<p>“Must have been done deliberately,” said the ladies
next door, “it absolutely <i>deluged</i> us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown removed his head from his hands.</p>

<p>“Where <i>is</i> he?” he groaned.</p>

<p>But no one knew where he was.</p>

<p>He was as a matter of fact at the other end of the
village. He was swaggering up to the Outlaws with
the brand new eight and six stumps under his arm.
The Outlaws were gaping at him stupefied with
amazement and admiration.</p>

<p>“Said I’d get the money,” said William airily,
“so I—I jus’ got it. Thought I might as well get the
things an’ bring ’em along with me. Here they
are.”</p>

<p>It was a moment worth living for.</p>

<p>William felt that he really didn’t care <i>what</i> happened
to him after that.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER V</small><br>

WILLIAM—THE AVENGER</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Outlaws had noticed and disliked him long
before the unforgivable outrage took place.</p>

<p>He had a tooth-brush moustache, a receding chin,
an objectionable high-pitched laugh and a still
more objectionable swagger. He admired himself
immensely.</p>

<p>Somehow the Outlaws sensed trouble from him as
soon as they saw him, even before they had found
out anything about him. The Outlaws, of course,
always made it their business to find out all about
any strangers who appeared in the village. His name,
they discovered, was Clarence Bergson, and he was
staying with the Holdings, who were renting the Hall.</p>

<p>Now this was unfortunate because William liked
the Holdings, or rather William liked Miss Holding,
and for Miss Holding’s sake accepted Mr. and Mrs.
Holding—large and pompous and dignified, and
disapproving of all small boys.</p>

<p>William admired Miss Holding because she was very
young and very, very pretty and had a twinkle in her
eye and a nice smile. He admired her in fact so much
that when first he heard that Clarence Bergson was
a friend of hers and staying at the Hall, he had been
quite willing to overlook the receding chin and the
high-pitched laughter and the objectionable swagger.</p>

<p>Clarence, however, rushed on to his doom. He
began by kicking William’s dog, Jumble, in the village
street. Technically, of course, he had some justification,
because Jumble made what appeared to be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
entirely unprovoked attack on him, barking furiously
and pretending to bite his plus-fours. In reality, it
was not unprovoked. They were very loud plus-fours,
and Jumble, although generally of the meekest and
mildest disposition possible, could not endure loud
plus-fours. He always barked at them and pretended
to bite them. They roused him to fury. Jumble
perhaps looked upon himself as the sartorial censor
of the village. Anyway, on the day on which Clarence
appeared in a pair of green and mauve plus-fours
(very green and very mauve) with red tabs, Jumble,
after one glance at them, made his usual feint of
attacking them, barking in shrill disapprobation till
Clarence’s foot sent him flying into the ditch.</p>

<p>The Outlaws met to consider what reprisals should
be taken to avenge this insult to William’s dog. It
was William, curiously enough, who minimised the
whole affair.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I don’t <i>like</i> him, but—but I
guess we’d better let him alone. You see, Jumble
did bark at his trousers, an’—well, anyway, I guess
we’d better let him alone.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws were disappointed. William’s attitude
was felt to be unworthy of a leader with a reputation
for avenging to the full any insult offered to him or
his dog or to a member of his band. Ginger had a
dark suspicion of the shameful truth. He had long
been troubled by a secret suspicion that William
admired Miss Holding—William, the leader, the
scornful despiser of all women. The suspicion had
depressed him very much.</p>

<p>The meeting broke up gloomily. William was
aware that his prestige was dimmed, but he clung
to his decision. Clarence, as guest and friend of Miss
Holding, must not be harmed. Little did Clarence
think, as he swaggered about the village with his
receding chin and high-pitched laugh and general
objectionableness, how narrowly he had been saved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Meeting William in the village he did not even recognise
him as the master of the dog whom he had kicked
into the ditch. And, not knowing how narrowly
he had escaped retribution, he proceeded to rush on
madly to his doom.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Outlaws—William and Ginger and Douglas and
Henry—were playing at Red Indians. They were
playing at Red Indians in one of Farmer Jenks’
fields. They were doing this because to play the
game in Farmer Jenks’ field lent it a certain excitement
which it would otherwise have lacked.</p>

<p>Farmer Jenks hated the Outlaws with that bitter
hatred which the landowner always bears to the
habitual trespasser, and pursued them determinedly
but unavailingly, whenever he caught sight of them.
Therefore, Farmer Jenks, all unknown to himself,
took an important part in the game. He represented
a hostile tribe of especially ferocious redskins. However
much the normal activities of the Red Indians
as enacted by the Outlaws should pall, there was
always the stimulating knowledge that at any minute
the hostile tribe, as enacted by Farmer Jenks, might
appear upon the scene, and this knowledge gave to
the whole affair the spice of danger and excitement
without which the Outlaws found life so barren.
The game this afternoon was proceeding rather
flatly.</p>

<p>A chestnut tree represented a tent. The Indians
Eagle Eye, Red Hand, Lion Heart and Swiftfoot
(otherwise William, Ginger, Douglas and Henry) were
engaged in various pursuits. Eagle Eye was out killing
wild animals for supper, Red Hand was climbing a
tree so as to be on the look-out for enemies, Lion
Heart was examining the “spoor” near the tent, and
had just announced the recent passage of a herd of
elephants and of hundreds of lions and tigers. Swiftfoot
had gone out to collect twigs for a fire, but had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
soon tired of the pastime and was practising cart
wheels by himself in a corner of the field.</p>

<p>Suddenly from Ginger’s vantage ground came the
shrill cry, “The Black Hearts,” and the stout purple-faced
form of Farmer Jenks was seen bearing down
upon them in the distance, while Ginger himself was
seen to shin down the tree trunk with almost incredible
rapidity.</p>

<p>At once Eagle Eye leapt from his slaughter of wild
animals, Lion Heart from his examinations of “spoor,”
and Swiftfoot from his cart wheels, and they set off
across the field in headlong flight, two in either
direction. They always split up into parties when
fleeing from Farmer Jenks.</p>

<p>Farmer Jenks, of course, could not bear the thought
that any of his quarry should elude him, and those
fatal few moments during which he stood in the
middle wondering which to follow, generally just
enabled the Outlaws to escape. They would have
escaped this time, too, if it hadn’t been for Clarence.</p>

<p>Farmer Jenks stood hesitating as usual for those
few fatal seconds in the middle of the field, then
decided to pursue Douglas and Henry, who (despite
Henry’s tribal name) were slightly less fleet of foot
than William and Ginger. And as I have said he would
not have caught them if it hadn’t been for Clarence.</p>

<p>Clarence happened to be passing down the road
at the moment and witnessed the rout of the braves
by the Black Hearts. Clarence was highly amused
by the spectacle and decided to play a little joke on
them on his own account.</p>

<p>So he stood at the stile, which was their only means
of exit, and caught them. He then handed over
Douglas to the perspiring and purple-faced Farmer
Jenks and held the wriggling Henry till Farmer Jenks
had quite finished with Douglas. Then he handed
him Henry. And all the while he stood by, laughing
his high-pitched laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Farmer Jenks was, as a matter of fact, too breathless
to do himself full justice in the chastisement of his
captures, but he did the best he could and then went
panting and grunting back to his desecrated territory.
Clarence, still laughing his high-pitched laugh, walked
down the road. Douglas and Henry slowly and painfully
rejoined William and Ginger in the old barn
which was their usual meeting-place.</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” began Douglas, in a tone of great bitterness
and anguish.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William grimly, “we saw. We jolly
well <i>saw</i>.”</p>

<p>“Comes of lettin’ him off when he kicked Jumble,”
went on Henry gloomily.</p>

<p>The silence that followed showed that the Outlaws
considered this last outrage to be due solely to William’s
unwarrantable clemency on the former occasion. It
was clear that even William himself felt guilty.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said sternly, “we jolly well won’t let
him off <i>this</i> time.”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do to him?” said Henry as he sat
down uneasily. (Douglas more wisely did not attempt
sitting down.) “I’d like to push him off a high
precipice into the sea.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t,” said Douglas the literal, “because
there aren’t any precipices here an’ there isn’t any
sea. I’d like to kill him, shootin’ arrows into him,
same as they did Saint Someone or other in a picture.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s silly,” said William impatiently,
“you’d only get hung for murd’rin’ him. Besides,
<i>you</i> can’t do <i>anything</i>! He saw you an’ he’d know
you by now. You leave this to me an’ Ginger. We’ll
avenge you all right. Don’t you worry. We’ll jolly
well avenge you. But you leave it all to us, ’cause
he knows you, an’ he don’t know us. We were too far
off for him to see us prop’ly.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you do?” said Douglas in the tone of one
who thirsts for blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>But William was a good tactician, forming no plans
till he had surveyed the enemy’s territory.</p>

<p>“We’ve gotter look round a bit first,” he said.
“You jus’ leave it all to Ginger an’ me.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Little did the smiling Clarence think, as he sat
with his beloved by the river bank, that two boys
were concealed in the bushes just behind him listening
to his conversation. He had, of course, no eyes or
ears for any but the beloved and he was finding it
quite up-hill work because, although he’d been paying
her attention now for nearly a fortnight, she didn’t
seem impressed or responsive.</p>

<p>She seemed, on the contrary, frankly bored, yawned
frequently, and quite often forgot even to pretend that
she was listening to him.</p>

<p>Clarence, who had a very good opinion of himself,
thought that she was merely shy and diffident, and
she was, of course, frightfully pretty.</p>

<p>So, unmoved by her silence and inadequate responses,
he continued to address his attentions to her.</p>

<p>“May I take you for a drive to-morrow?” he
pleaded.</p>

<p>“No,” said Miss Holding very firmly. “I shan’t
be at home to-morrow. I’m going to some friends
at Beechtop. I’m going to have lunch with them.
Then we’re going to take out our tea to the river bank
and picnic there.”</p>

<p>“May I come and help?” said Clarence.</p>

<p>“How could you help?” said Miss Holding
brusquely.</p>

<p>“I could—er—wash up and carry things, and—er—bring
you home.”</p>

<p>She relented.</p>

<p>“All right. You can come over for tea if you like.”</p>

<p>“Where shall I come—and when?” said Clarence.</p>

<p>“Come about four then,” said Miss Holding, “to
the bank near the church. It’s rather pretty there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
It’s by the roadside, but there’s a good stretch of
bank with nice trees.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said Clarence fervently.</p>

<p>Then they got up and began to walk along the road
to the village. Clarence’s high-pitched laugh rang
out as they went.</p>

<p>William and Ginger emerged from their leafy shelter
and looked after the departing figures.</p>

<p>“I bet he’s telling her about it,” said Ginger gloomily.
“Well, what we’ve gotter do,” said William, “is to go
to this ole picnic an’ see if we can’t do somethin’ to
him there. I don’t care if we <i>do</i> spoil her picnic.”</p>

<p>He spoke rather wistfully. The sight and sound of
Miss Holding had increased his admiration. But
loyalty to her, of course, was as nothing to his loyalty
to his Outlaws. Clarence had insulted Douglas and
Henry and so Clarence must be punished. He
hardened his heart against her.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Ginger, and then mournfully,
“but Beechtop’s a <i>jolly</i> long way off. It’s miles an’
miles an’ miles. How’re we goin’ to get there?”</p>

<p>“Walk,” said William sternly.</p>

<p>Ginger groaned.</p>

<p>“We’ve <i>gotter</i> take a little trouble avengin’ Douglas
an’ Henry,” said William irritably. “We’ll start
early—d’rectly after lunch, an’ we’ll get there jus’
about tea-time, I bet.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They started directly after lunch and had they
gone straight there they might easily have arrived
before tea-time. But the Outlaws, even when on
vengeance bent, were still the Outlaws. They could
not pass anything on a road which seemed to call
for investigation. And the road positively teemed
with such things. There was a pond which delayed
them for quite a quarter of an hour. Then there was
a tree which Ginger said William couldn’t climb and
which William therefore had to climb, though it took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
him ten minutes, and tore his coat and nearly broke
his neck. Then there was a boy who jeered at
William’s personal appearance—both pond and tree
had left their marks upon him—and was challenged
by William to single combat. The fight lasted between
five and ten minutes, then, battered but victorious,
William rejoined Ginger and they resumed their journey.</p>

<p>“Wonder if we’re nearly there,” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“Course we aren’t,” said William, “it’s ever so
many miles yet.”</p>

<p>“S’pose we don’t get there before they’ve started
home,” said Ginger pessimistically.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t wasted all that time over that pond
an’ things——” said William, sublimely ignoring his
own part in the delays.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Ginger indignantly, “well! I like
that!—an’ you climbin’ trees an’ fightin’ boys an’—an’
anyway, we don’ even know what we’re goin’ to
do when we do get there.”</p>

<p>“Somethin’ sure to turn up to do when we get
there,” said William optimistically. “Trouble is,”
and his depression returned to him, “<i>gettin’</i> there—miles
an’ miles an’ miles.”</p>

<p>Just then they heard the sound of a motor cycle
behind them and turned round.</p>

<p>“It’s him,” whispered William.</p>

<p>Clarence, be-goggled and wearing a radiant leather
coat, flashed by. In flashing by he swerved slightly.
Ginger sprang to one side, slipped and fell.</p>

<p>“Lie right down and keep your eyes shut,” hissed
William quickly.</p>

<p>Ginger obediently lay inert in the road.</p>

<p>“Hi!” called William after Clarence.</p>

<p>Clarence slowed down and turned round. He saw
Ginger lying inert in the road and a look of horror came
into his face. Slowly he wheeled his motor cycle
back.</p>

<p>“I didn’t knock him down,” he said aggressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Didn’t you <i>just</i>!” said William severely. “You
came right over this side of the road.”</p>

<p>To his relief it was quite evident that Clarence did
not recognise them. He had only seen them in the
distance in Farmer Jenks’ field. To him they were
just two strange boys. Ginger still lay in the dust,
his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Clarence took out his handkerchief and mopped his
brow.</p>

<p>“I—er—I remember swerving a little. But I felt
nothing. I’m sure I didn’t go over him.”</p>

<p>“No,” said William rather regretfully, for it would
be impossible even to pretend that any motor cycle
had passed over the solid and obviously intact form
of Ginger. “You didn’t go <i>over</i> him, but you—you
swerved right on to him an’ gave him a t’riffic blow
on his head. He’s got—he’s got,” the word came with
a flash of inspiration, “’cussion. That’s what he’s got.
He’s got ’cussion.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he has,” said Clarence, but he
sounded uncertain and he watched the motionless
figure of Ginger anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s unconscious, isn’t he?” said William, in
the tone of one who states an indubitable fact.</p>

<p>“I expect it just gave him a fright,” said Clarence,
then brightening, “anyway he looks healthy enough,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“They always look healthy with ’cussion,” said
William darkly, and with such an air of knowledge
that Clarence’s face fell again. “I—I once knew a
boy what had ’cussion jus’ like that. A motor cycle
swerved into him and he lay for a few minutes lookin’
healthy—lookin’ <i>very</i> healthy—that’s one of the signs
of ’cussion—unconscious jus’ like that—an’ soon he
came round an’ sat up an’ said, ‘Where am I?’—same
as they always say—an’ then he said that he’d
got a most awful pain jus’ above his ears—that’s
where you always feel the pain in ’cussion—an’ they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
took him home moanin’ an’ groanin’ somethin’ t’riffic,
an’ lookin’ quite healthy all the time same as they
always do in ’cussion, an’ he died jus’ when he’d been
at home for about an’ hour, moanin’ and groanin’
somethin’ t’riffic, he died. The man what swerved
into him was put in prison.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Clarence heartily, but he didn’t
look hearty and he didn’t feel hearty.</p>

<p>William wore his most guileless expression. No
one could look more like a boy who is telling the truth
than William when he wasn’t telling the truth.
Experts had often been deceived by it. Just as
Clarence stood trying to feel as hearty as he sounded
and to rid himself of the effect of William’s earnest
words and guileless look, Ginger, in obedience to a
surreptitious prod from William’s foot, sat up in the
dust and said, “Where am I?”</p>

<p>William bent over him in tender solicitude.</p>

<p>“You’re here, Ginger dear, on the road.” Then quite
politely he effected the introduction. “This is the
gentleman who knocked you down with his motor
cycle.”</p>

<p>Clarence blinked again, and again tried to be hearty.</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure you feel all right, my boy, now,”
he said.</p>

<p>But Ginger began to moan in a particularly resonant
manner, rather like the mooing of a cow.</p>

<p>“Where do you feel the pain, Ginger dear?”
inquired William tenderly.</p>

<p>Ginger stopped moaning to say:</p>

<p>“Jus’ above my ears.”</p>

<p>“<i>There!</i>” said William, as if greatly impressed.
“It <i>is</i> ’cussion; I <i>said</i> it was ’cussion. Do you feel as
if you could walk, Ginger dear?”</p>

<p>Ginger, who had started mooing again, stopped to
say “No.”</p>

<p>Clarence, who was beginning to look like a man in
the grip of a nightmare, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“At Beechtop,” said William shamelessly, “jus’
near the river.”</p>

<p>“I—I’ll take him home then,” said the bewildered
and apprehensive Clarence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William. “I think we’d better get him
home. Sometimes they go off so quick with ’cussion.”</p>

<p>Between them they lifted the loudly moaning
Ginger on to the pillion.</p>

<p>“I’ll get on with him, shall I?” said William, “then
if he goes off sudd’nly on the way, I can catch him.”</p>

<p>William and Ginger enjoyed the drive to Beechtop
tremendously. It was far nicer than walking. Ginger
enjoyed it so much that he kept forgetting to moan
and had to be recalled to his duty by kicks and prods
from William. At Beechtop Clarence stopped.</p>

<p>“Where does he live exactly?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s jus’ near here,” said William. “Do you
feel a little better, Ginger dear? Do you feel you
could walk?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ginger, who had now stopped moaning,
“I feel I could walk a bit now.”</p>

<p>Clarence looked relieved and recovered something of
his aplomb.</p>

<p>“Your own fault entirely,” he said, “for not keeping
right at the side of the road.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to the river bank where Miss
Holding and her friends awaited him.</p>

<p>He had completely forgotten the episode a few
minutes later when he sat among the other guests on
the bank, making little jokes and laughing his high-pitched
laugh and handing round bags of cakes.</p>

<p>It was some time before he noticed William’s face
peering at him through the bushes making contortions
which were obviously meant to be signs of some sort.
The memory came back to him like the memory of a
nightmare. His smile died away and his high-pitched
laugh stopped abruptly on its highest note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“I’ll—er—I’ll fetch some more cakes,” he said,
and went over to the provision basket near which
William’s face had loomed through the bushes.</p>

<p>Pretending to busy himself with the provisions, he
snapped:</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>From behind the bushes where William’s face had
now discreetly withdrawn itself came a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>“It is ’cussion. He’s vi’lently ill.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it,” hissed Clarence irritably.
“He must have been standing right in the way. I
can’t do anything.”</p>

<p>“No,” said William. “No, I know you can’t.
But they say he’s gotter have a lot of nourishment
an’ his mother’s not got any food in the house ’cause
of them bein’ very poor—<i>ever</i> so poor. So if you
could let me have a few cakes an’ things for him I’d
take them to his house for him. The doctor says he
can have rich things—he’d like some of those cakes
with cream on——”</p>

<p>“All right,” hissed Clarence. “I’ll—I’ll get some
for you. Only—go away.”</p>

<p>“If you sit down here an’ put them behind you—I’ll
take ’em from you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” hissed Clarence, in a fever lest anyone
should notice his visitor or hear his visitor’s penetrating
whisper. He sat down by the basket, very much
irritated because it was right away from Miss Holding,
and began to talk to a girl with red hair. As he
talked he pushed cakes into the bushes. He talked
excitedly and increasingly to divert attention from his
activities and frequently stopped to mop his brow with
his mauve silk handkerchief. He’d had a lot of nightmares
in his life, but none as bad as this.</p>

<p>Meanwhile behind him in the bushes William and
Ginger sat down happily to their splendid feast.</p>

<p>“It’s most peculiar,” Miss Holding was heard to
say, “I can’t think what’s happened to all the iced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
cakes. We bought heaps, but they all seem to have
gone.”</p>

<p>“Most mysterious,” said the girl with the red hair.
“Never mind, we’ll make the most of the biscuits.”</p>

<p>Clarence began to talk to the red-haired girl again.
He was just forgetting his fears and beginning to talk
more or less sensibly when he felt a prod in the back.</p>

<p>“He’s finished all those things what you sent,”
hissed William’s voice, “an’ the doctor says he’s
gotter have some more nourishment. His ’cussion’s
getting worse an’ worse.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">CLARENCE TALKED EXCITEDLY TO DIVERT ATTENTION,
AND AS HE TALKED HE PUSHED CAKES INTO THE BUSHES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I don’t wonder if he’s eaten all that stuff I gave
you,” said Clarence bitterly.</p>

<p>“You’ve gotter eat with ’cussion. It’s the only
thing to do to save your life—to go on eatin’ an’ eatin’.
Can I have that bag of biscuits for him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well—I’ll ask Miss Holding. P’r’aps if I tell her
about you knockin’ him down, she’ll give me some for
him.” Hastily Clarence seized the bag of biscuits
and pushed them into the bushes.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_133">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“IT’S MOST PECULIAR,” SAID MISS HOLDING. “I CAN’T
THINK WHAT’S HAPPENED TO ALL THE ICED CAKES.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Good heavens,” said Miss Holding, looking around
her a few minutes later, “all the biscuits seem to have
gone now.”</p>

<p>“It’s always from Mr. Bergson’s corner that things
go,” said the youngest guest, aged thirteen. “I’ve
seen all the things just near him and then when you
look again a minute later they aren’t there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Everyone turned and stared at Clarence who grew
red to the tips of his ears.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last desperately, “I—I’ve had
quite a long drive. It—it makes one hungry.”</p>

<p>“He must have eaten all that pound of biscuits as
well as the two dozen iced cakes,” said the youngest
guest dispassionately.</p>

<p>“Hush, dear,” said her mother, reproachfully, and
conversation became general, but Clarence could not
help noticing that there seemed to be a tendency to
avoid him. And things had hardly become normal
again when he felt once more that painful prod in the
back that heralded William’s penetrating whisper:</p>

<p>“I’ve just been to see him again and——”</p>

<p>“I’m not giving you anything else,” hissed Clarence.</p>

<p>“No. He doesn’t want anything now. He’s too
ill to eat now. His ’cussion’s something t’riffic now.
They’re awful mad about it. His father’s just sent
for a policeman——”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>“To take down all about you knockin’ ’im down,
case he dies and you have to go to prison.”</p>

<p>The red-haired girl turned to Clarence.</p>

<p>“Were you speaking to me, Mr. Bergson?” she said
politely.</p>

<p>Clarence took out his mauve silk handkerchief and
mopped his brow again.</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” he said, “I was just remarking what—er—what
a beautiful view.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” said the red-haired girl coldly
(she simply couldn’t get over this man’s having eaten
two dozen iced cakes and a pound of biscuits). “I
think it’s very ordinary.”</p>

<p>William and Ginger had left the bushes. Gorged
with cakes and in a state of hazy content they were
walking down the road towards a point at the road
where a policeman stood directing the very scanty
traffic which came from a side road. They had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
finished with Clarence yet. The Outlaws never went
in for half measures. On the way they passed a public
house called “The Staff of Life,” and on a bench just
outside lounged an enormous man with cross-eyes
and abnormally long arms and wearing a smile which
in the distance looked ferocious, but on nearer approach
became merely fatuous. William and Ginger watched
him with interest as they passed him and then, forgetting
him, approached the policeman.</p>

<p>William assumed his expression of innocence.</p>

<p>“Please sir,” he said, “there’s a gentleman down
there what’s just had his pocket picked. He told me
to go’n see if I could find a policeman.”</p>

<p>The policeman took out a pocket-book.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” he said eagerly. Evidently he
welcomed the interruption. There had only been
one cart along the side road in the last three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p>“He’s with a picnic party down by the bank,”
said William guilelessly, “he’s dressed in a leather
coat.”</p>

<p>Then William and Ginger melted silently away.
The policeman, still holding his note-book, went down
to the bank.</p>

<p>Clarence was just beginning to feel that he was
returning to favour. He was talking about his motor cycle.</p>

<p>“Sixty miles an hour is nothing to me,” he said,
“there’s no danger at all to a good driver in sixty
miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s what makes you so hungry, I suppose,”
said the youngest guest, as if a problem which had
long been troubling her were solved at last.</p>

<p>Her mother said, “Hush, dear,” and again the
atmosphere was slightly strained.</p>

<p>“How fast did you come here to-day, Mr. Bergson?”
said the youngest guest’s mother, feeling that it was
up to her to restore the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Clarence’s complacency dropped from him as he
thought of how fast he’d come there.</p>

<p>“Oh—er—it varied,” he said absently.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_136">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">ALL ALONG BY THE RIVER BANK WENT CLARENCE, AND
BEHIND HIM IN HOT PURSUIT CAME THE POLICEMAN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What had that little wretch said? A policeman
taking down details! It was a horrible thought. He
took out the mauve silk handkerchief and wiped his
brow again. His mauve silk handkerchief was becoming
quite damp. And then—his eyes almost started
out of his head. Here was the policeman coming
down the river bank and right up to him—the policeman
who must have come straight from the bedside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
of the boy he’d knocked down—with his note-book in
his hand.</p>

<p>Clarence didn’t stop to think. He leapt to his feet
and took to his heels. The policeman didn’t stop to
think either. He saw someone running away from
him so, from sheer force of habit, he ran after him.
Along the road by the river bank went Clarence, and
behind him, in hot pursuit, the stalwart figure of the
policeman.</p>

<p>“Well!” said the picnic party, giving inadequate
expression to its feelings.</p>

<p>“He seemed to me all the afternoon,” said the girl
with red hair, darkly, “like a man with something on
his mind.”</p>

<p>“Fancy him being able to run like that,” said the
youngest guest admiringly, “when he’s just eaten two
dozen iced cakes and a pound of biscuits. I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Hush, dear,” said her mother absently.</p>

<p>“There was something about a murder in this
morning’s paper,” said the girl with red hair. “I
shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he did it.”</p>

<p>“Surely not,” objected someone.</p>

<p>“Well, why should a policeman come for him and
he run off like this? Most of these murders in the
papers are done by quite ordinary people living quite
ordinary lives, you know. He must be one of them.
I expect he’ll have caught him by now. He’ll be
hung, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll have had a jolly good tuck-in first,” said
the youngest guest.</p>

<p>“Hush, dear,” said her mother. “Of course it
may not be an actual murder. It may be merely
robbing a bank or forging a will or something.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always wanted to know a criminal,” said the
girl with red hair, heaving a sigh of content, “and I’ve
thought he seemed queer all the afternoon. He’s
been muttering to himself into the bushes and behaving
most peculiarly all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Well, if you don’t mind,” said the youngest
guest’s mother, “I’ll take girlie home. One doesn’t
want to be mixed up in this sort of thing—as a witness
or jury or anything—and one never knows who a
murderer will murder next. They say that it sort
of grows on them. If he’s overpowered the policeman—and
criminals have the strength of ten men—or is
that lunatics?—he may be coming back here in search
of fresh victims. He’s probably got homicidal mania—breaking
out in spasms, you know.”</p>

<p>She collected the youngest guest and drifted away.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go too,” said the girl with red hair.
“I don’t believe in running unnecessary risks and
one does hear of such things in the papers. I could
tell the minute I set eyes on him that he wasn’t normal.”</p>

<p>Gradually the other guests followed her example,
and when Clarence finally returned panting and
breathless, only Miss Holding was left by the river
bank among the ruins of the feast. Or rather only
Miss Holding was apparently left, for William and
Ginger had returned to their leafy shelter and were
watching with interest to see what turn events would
take.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Miss Holding, as Clarence, holding on
to his sides with both hands, came panting up to her
and sank on to the river bank by her side. “What in
the world——?”</p>

<p>“A mistake,” gasped Clarence, “he’d heard—that
a man—had had his—pocket picked—thought it—was
me—mistake.”</p>

<p>“But why on earth did you run away?” said Miss
Holding.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” panted Clarence.</p>

<p>“I remember once reading about a man who did
that,” said Miss Holding. “He’d had an awful
dream about a policeman coming for him and the
next day he took to his heels as soon as he set eyes on
one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Yes,” said Clarence, eagerly accepting the explanation,
“that was what happened to me. I had a most
terrible dream about a policeman last night and as
soon as I saw this one coming up to me my—my
dream sort of—came over me again and I—I just ran
away. Force of association!”</p>

<p>Miss Holding laughed.</p>

<p>“Well. I think I can squeeze you out another cup
of tea to refresh you and there’s a lot of plain cake
left in spite of the mysterious disappearance of the
iced ones.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Clarence lay back on the river bank and smoked
cigarettes and drank tea and ate plain cake. Then,
refreshed and invigorated, he began to talk again.
He began to talk about himself.</p>

<p>He began to tell her all about his past life—what
noble and heroic things he had done and what a noble
and heroic character he was. Miss Holding was kind
to him. She led him on. The listeners’ spirits fell.
This was not how they had meant their vengeance
to end—in this pleasant conversation on the river
bank. All they seemed to have done was to have
cleared the stage for Clarence’s courtship.</p>

<p>And it was quite evident that Clarence had
completely forgotten his victim who now lay (presumably)
in the throes of concussion. They were full of
virtuous horror at the thought. Then they turned
and looked at each other—Ginger with the serene,
trusting face of one who knows that his leader will
evolve some plan, and William with that ferocious
scowl which in William betokened deep thought.
Then suddenly the scowl cleared and there flashed
across his freckled face the light that betokened
inspiration.</p>

<p>“I’ll just go down to the river and wash this cup,”
Miss Holding was saying. “No, don’t move. As a
matter of fact I’d much rather wash it myself. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
never let anyone else wash my picnic cups. They
don’t do them properly.”</p>

<p>Clarence, nothing loth, remained on the bank in
the sunshine while Miss Holding went down to the
water. Then—just as Clarence’s thoughts were
happily flitting round the attractive figure that he
imagined himself to be cutting—suddenly that awful
boy’s face appeared through the bushes again making
horrible grimaces. The smile dropped from Clarence’s
face.</p>

<p>“Go away!” he hissed, putting out a hand to push
William’s face back into the bushes.</p>

<p>“I’ve just come from him,” said William. “He’s
ever so much worse.”</p>

<p>“It’s not my fault,” hissed Clarence.</p>

<p>“I know it isn’t,” said William sympathetically.
“I keep tellin’ ’em it wasn’t really your fault an’
that you didn’t run over him on purpose, but they
won’t listen to me. His father’s out lookin’ for you
now. He’s an awful man with cross-eyes an’ very
long arms. He say he’s going to wring your neck.”</p>

<p>Clarence went pale, but at that moment Miss Holding
returned from washing up the cup, and Clarence,
relieved at the sudden disappearance of William’s face,
made an effort to entertain her again. He told her
about the time he had made a century at cricket at
his prep. school, but somehow, despite the fact that she
was obviously impressed, he couldn’t put any real zest
into the narrative. Cross-eyed and with very long
arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile William and Ginger were creeping silently
away from the bushes. It was not for nothing that
the Outlaws played Red Indians nearly every day.
Not even the cracking of a twig betrayed their passage.</p>

<p>Outside on the main road they looked cautiously
up and down to see if the policeman (who was presumably
thirsting for their blood) was anywhere in sight.
To their relief he wasn’t, and to their still greater relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
the cross-eyed man was. He was still sitting on the
seat outside “The Staff of Life,” contemplating the
road crossways with his ferocious smile. William
assumed his guileless expression again and they
approached him.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” began William politely, “would you
like a few cakes?”</p>

<p>The man glared at him and at Ginger simultaneously,
and smiled his ferocious smile.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t mind,” he admitted, condescendingly.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on William, “there’s a gentleman an’
a lady havin’ a picnic down on the river bank jus’
behind those bushes, an’ the gentleman told me to
find someone what’d like the cakes what’s left over
an’ send ’em to him to fetch ’em.”</p>

<p>The man rose slowly.</p>

<p>“Well—I don’t mind,” he said, and set off towards
the river bank.</p>

<p>Clarence had passed on from the story of the century
he had made at his prep. school and was telling her
about the time when he’d put a drawing-pin on a
master’s chair at his public school.</p>

<p>Miss Holding seemed very much interested. Everything
seemed to be going very nicely. His spirits
were gradually rising. He didn’t believe that he’d
really hurt the boy or that his father was out looking
for him. “Cross-eyed and long arms”—it was ridiculous.
He wouldn’t be surprised if that wretched boy
had made up the whole thing.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he stopped short. His eyes bulged
and his mouth dropped open. A man with cross-eyes
and long arms and a ferocious smile was coming down
the river bank, towards him. It was true. It was
the boy’s father coming to wring his neck.</p>

<p>With a yell of terror as loud and shrill as a factory
siren Clarence leapt to his feet, leapt over the bushes
and rushed down the road. He did not stop running
till he reached home.</p>

SOME.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>The cross-eyed man and Miss Holding stood gazing
after his retreating figure. Then the cross-eyed man
turned, and looking simultaneously at Miss Holding
and the bushes said with dispassionate interest:</p>

<p>“’As somethin’ stung him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know <i>what’s</i> happened to him,” said Miss
Holding.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the cross-eyed man, abandoning all
attempts to solve the mystery of Clarence’s flight,
“they told me that if I came along ’ere they’d give
me some cake.”</p>

<p>“You can have all that’s left,” said Miss Holding,
“but who told you?”</p>

<p>One of the cross-eyed man’s eyes had espied a
movement in the neighbouring bushes. He dived
into it and emerged holding William by his collar.</p>

<p>“This ’ere nipper,” he said.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The cross-eyed man had departed with his booty.</p>

<p>William and Ginger sat on the river bank on either
side of Miss Holding.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity we gave him all the buns and plain
cake,” said Miss Holding, “because I’m sure you’d
have liked some.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” said William politely, and added
with perfect truth, “we—we’ve sort of had enough.”</p>

<p>A gleam of intelligence shone in Miss Holding’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in that bush?” she said.</p>

<p>“Quite a long time,” said William, “on and off.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Miss Holding, “you accounted for
the two dozen iced cakes and the pound of biscuits.”</p>

<p>William assumed his guileless expression.</p>

<p>“Well,” he admitted, “Mr. Bergson did kin’ly give
us something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said Miss Holding, “that you tell me
all about it.” So they told her.</p>

<p>At the end she dried her eyes and said: “It’s perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
priceless and the best part of it all is that I’m sure it
will make him go home.”</p>

<p>And it did.</p>

<p>They had a lovely journey home packed into Miss
Holding’s two-seater, and the first person they saw in
the village was Mrs. Holding.</p>

<p>“Whatever’s happened to Clarence?” said Mrs.
Holding.</p>

<p>“What has?” said Miss Holding.</p>

<p>“He came home in a most peculiar condition,”
went on Mrs. Holding. “He said he’d been running
all the way. And he took the first train back to town
and wants his things sent on after him. He told me
not to give his address to anyone.”</p>

<p>“I’m <i>so</i> glad,” said Miss Holding serenely, “because
I was getting bored even with pulling his leg.”</p>

<p>“But what happened?” said her mother.</p>

<p>“He just got up and ran home, didn’t he, children?”
said Miss Holding dreamily. “I should think that he
suffers from spasmodic insanity. These two little
boys have been such a help to me this afternoon,
mother. Come and let’s find somewhere to have an
ice cream, children.”</p>

<p>William hesitated.</p>

<p>“We oughter go’n’ tell Douglas and Henry that
we’ve avenged them first,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Miss Holding. “Go and find them
and bring them along too, and we’ll all go and have
ices somewhere.”</p>

<p>And as William remarked blissfully that evening, it
was one of the jolliest vengeances they’d ever had.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER VI</small><br>

PARROTS FOR ETHEL</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Outlaws were depressed. Ordinary pursuits
had lost their charms. They neither ran nor
leapt nor played Red Indians nor ranged the countryside
nor carried on guerrilla warfare with the neighbouring
farmers. Instead they held meetings in each
other’s back gardens, in each other’s shrubberies and
summer-houses and tool-sheds, eloquently discoursing
on the gravity of the situation, but finding no remedy
for it.</p>

<p>The cause of the whole trouble was the fatal
attractiveness of William’s sister Ethel. Not that
William or any of his friends actually admitted the
fatal attractiveness. Ethel was to them an ordinary
disagreeable “grown up” with a haughty manner and
impossible standards of cleanliness, who happened
also to possess a combination of red hair and blue
eyes that had a strange and unaccountable effect upon
adult members of the opposite sex. They cherished
always a stern and bitter contempt for Ethel’s admirers.
And now Douglas’s brother George and Ginger’s
brother Hector had joined the number. It is impossible
to describe the shame and horror the Outlaws felt at
this. That any member of any family of theirs should
stoop to the supreme indignity of admiring Ethel....
William felt as deeply outraged as any of them. He
felt that the infatuation of Douglas’s brother and
Ginger’s brother for his sister exposed the whole body
of Outlaws to the scorn of their friends and the laughter
of their foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>The possibility of it had hitherto never even occurred
to them. Douglas’s brother George and Ginger’s
brother Hector, though objectionable in every other
way as only elder brothers can be, had at least been
satisfactory in that, almost as much as the Outlaws
themselves, they held the female sex in scorn. It was
Ethel’s influenza that seemed to have made the
difference. Ethel had withdrawn from public life
for a term of fourteen days or so with the high temperature,
the streaming eyes and the settled pessimism
which, taken together, constitute Influenza. Evidently
the sudden absence of Ethel’s familiar figure from the
lanes and roads of her native village awoke strange
feelings in the breast of George and Hector, and the
emergence of Ethel from her sick room at the end of
the fortnight with, as it seemed by contrast with her
absence, redoubled beauty, completed their enslavement.
They abandoned their old manner of cold
indifference to her. They smiled at her ingratiatingly,
they bought new ties and new socks, they waited at
spots that it was probable that Ethel would pass.
Their old friendship with each other cooled. When
waiting at the same spot for a word or a glance from
Ethel they affected not to see each other. They
passed each other in the village street with no other
recognition than a scornful curl of the lip. They
no longer discussed the football results with each
other. They no longer borrowed each other’s bicycle
pumps. In the privacy of their home circle they
naturally vented all the bitterness of the pangs of
love upon their younger brothers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Outlaws had met in the summer-house of
William’s garden. Henry was away staying with an
aunt and only the three deeply involved parties—William,
Douglas and Ginger—were present.</p>

<p>“People <i>laughin’</i> at ’em,” said Douglas bitterly.
“I know they are from somethin’ someone said to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
yesterday. S’nice for <i>me</i>,” he added with an air of
impersonal bitterness, “s’nice for <i>me</i> havin’ a brother
what everyone’s laughin’ at.”</p>

<p>“’S jus’ as bad for me,” retorted Ginger. “An’ ’s
not only that. It’s makin’ Hector crabbier an’
crabbier at home.”</p>

<p>This reminded Douglas of his latest grievance.</p>

<p>“Took it off me,” he said fiercely, “took it off me
and threw it away. An’ it was new too. ’S no good
at all now. Threw it into the ditch an’ it’s full of
mud now an’ won’t play anyway whatever I do.
It’s ru’ned. An’ it was the best mouth-organ I’ve ever
had. It made a noise you could hear for miles and
miles. And he took it off me ’n’ threw it away. An’
I wasn’t makin’ much noise. I was only practisin’—practisin’
jus’ outside his room. Well, <i>I</i> din’ know
he was makin’ up po’try about Ethel. He needn’t’ve
come out roarin’ mad at me like that. I bet I’ve got
’s much right to practise my mouth-organ as he’s got
writin’ po’try to Ethel.”</p>

<p>“Jus’ <i>’xactly</i> what Hector did to me ’n my trumpet
last night,” said Ginger, torn between impersonal
interest in the coincidence and a personal sense of
grievance at the memory of his wrongs. “Came out
ravin’ mad at me jus’ ’cause I was sittin’ on the top
of the stairs practisin’ a trumpet. Came ravin’ mad
out of his room an’ took it off me an’ broke it.
<i>D’lib’rately</i> broke it. I bet <i>he</i> was writin’ po’try ’bout
Ethel too.” He threw William a cold glance. “Seems
to me,” he said, “a pity some people can’t stop their
sisters goin’ about the world makin’ all this mis’ry.
Breakin’ people’s trumpets an’ throwin’ people’s
mouth-organs away.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ethel</i> din’t break your trumpets an’ throw your
mouth-organs away,” said William with spirit. “Pity
some people can’t stop their brothers actin’ so stupid
whenever they see a girl.”</p>

<p>“They don’t,” retorted Ginger, “they’ve never done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
it before. They’ve always acted to girls same as we do—till
this set-out with Ethel,” he ended gloomily.</p>

<p>“Well,” said William with odious complacency,
“that only proves that Ethel’s nicer ’n all the other
girls.”</p>

<p>Their attitude seemed to be inexplicably deteriorating
from a common, lofty scorn of the work of the
blind god to a partisanship each of his particular
family.</p>

<p>“Oh, it does, does it?” said Ginger aggressively.
But William was not to be drawn into personal
combat on behalf of Ethel. He was, as a matter of
fact, a little bored with the whole proceedings. He
disapproved of the situation no less than he had
always disapproved of it, but meeting in summer-houses
and tool-sheds and discoursing on it did not
seem to make it any better and meanwhile the days
of the holidays were slipping by wasted. Moreover,
the day before an uncle of William’s had taken him
up to London, and so William was taking for the
time being a broader perspective of life than his
friends.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said pacifically. “There’s other
things to do than keep talkin’ about it an’ there’s
other people in the world ’sides Ethel an’ your ole
George an’ Hector.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Douglas bitterly, “you’d say that if it
was <i>your</i> mouth-organ, wun’t you?”</p>

<p>“An’ you’d say that if it was <i>your</i> trumpet,” said
Ginger. “Huh! I bet I’ve not got other things to do
than forget about that trumpet.”</p>

<p>“Come to that,” said William, “Ethel took my
bow an’ arrer off me yesterday ’cause it accident’ly
came through her window and broke an ole vase, but
I don’ keep talkin’ about it.”</p>

<p>But Ginger refused to be drawn from his grievance.</p>

<p>“He oughter be made to give me a new one,” he
said, and added with a melancholy sigh, “An’ jus’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
to think that wherever there’s grown-up brothers
there’s things like this hap’nin’ all over the country
what never get into the newspaper an’ England
supposed to be a free country—people’s trumpets
bein’ took off them an’ <i>broke</i> for no reason at all.
What’s that if it’s not tyranny what the history books
talk about? All I c’n say is,” he added darkly,
“that all those Magna Charter an’ things what the
history books say brought Lib’ty to England don’
seem to’ve done <i>me</i> much good.”</p>

<p>But Douglas had at last, like William, tired of the
subject.</p>

<p>“What did your uncle take you to see yesterday,
William?” he said.</p>

<p>“He took me to a place with a lot of dead animals—stuffed
mostly—but some skeletons—an’ a man
givin’ lectures on ’em—tellin’ us about them an’ what
they were like an’ what they did.”</p>

<p>“Was he int’restin’?” said Ginger temporarily
relinquishing his grievance, as no one would listen to
it any longer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William simply, “he’d got a loose
tooth what you could see movin’ when he talked, an’
there was a boy there what thought he could make
faces better’n me, but he found out in the end he
jolly well couldn’t.”</p>

<p>The atmosphere was certainly lightened by this
breath from the outside world. The Outlaws began
to think that perhaps they had discussed the Ethel-George-Hector
affair to satiety and the description of
William’s excursion of yesterday might afford a little
more interest.</p>

<p>“Did he give you a nice dinner, William?” said
Douglas.</p>

<p>“Crumbs, yes!” said William, “he let me choose
what I’d have for dinner an’ I had six ices an’ then
there were some things like cakes with heaps ’n’ heaps
of cream on an’ I had twelve of them an’ then I had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
bottle of orange squash an’ then I had two plates of
trifle.”</p>

<p>“No meat nor potatoes?” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“No,” said William, and added in simple explanation,
“I c’n get meat an’ potatoes at home.”</p>

<p>There was a silence during which the Outlaws
wistfully contemplated the mental vision of William’s
dinner. Then Ginger said bitterly: “That’s the best
of uncles. You’d never catch an aunt letting you
have a dinner like that,” and he added plaintively,
“all mine seem to be aunts.”</p>

<p>“What sort of animals were they, William?” asked
Douglas.</p>

<p>“All sorts,” said William, “an’”—slowly—“I’ve
been thinkin’. It’d be quite easy to get up a show like
that but with live animals ’stead of stuffed ones. I
know,” he said quickly, forestalling possible objection,
“that we’ve often tried shows <i>somethin’</i> like that but
not <i>quite</i> like. We’ve never tried <i>lecturin’</i> on ’em.
We’ve tried havin’ ’em for a circus and we’ve tried
sellin’ ’em but we’ve never tried lecturin’ on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, who can lecture on ’em?” said Douglas.</p>

<p>“I can,” said William promptly. “I heard that
man doin’ it an’ so I bet I know how to do it now.”</p>

<p>“Can you woggle your teeth?” said Douglas.</p>

<p>“It’s not <i>ne’ssary</i> to woggle your teeth lecturin’ on
animals,” said William coldly. “’Sides, I bet I could
if I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“I could bring my dormouse,” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“An’ there’s my insecks,” said William, “an’
Jumble an’—all our cats.”</p>

<p>“That’s not <i>much</i>,” said Douglas. “How do they
get animals for the big places like the Zoo?”</p>

<p>“People lend ’em,” said Ginger, “or give ’em. I’ve
often heard of people givin’ ’em. When the Roy’l
Fam’ly goes abroad for its holiday people give ’em
animals an’ they bring ’em home and give ’em to the
Zoo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Seems a funny sort of thing to do,” said Douglas
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve read about it in newspapers so it mus’
be true.”</p>

<p>“’F what my father says about newspapers is true,”
objected Ginger, “nothin’ in any of ’em’s true.”</p>

<p>“<i>Somethin’</i> in <i>some</i> of ’em <i>must</i> be,” objected
Douglas, “’cause——”</p>

<p>William determinedly dragged the conversation back
from the possible truth or untruth of newspapers to
the matter in hand.</p>

<p>“Well, ’bout these animals,” he said. “We’ll have
it in our summer-house an’ I’ll lecture on ’em an’
we’ll have all our cats an’ Jumble an’ we’ll c’leck some
more insecks an’ we’ll have Ginger’s dormouse an’ we’ll
get people to lend us other animals or p’raps give
us ’em.”</p>

<p>“Who?” said Douglas gloomily.</p>

<p>“Who what?”</p>

<p>“Who you think’ll give us <i>anythin’</i>, much less an
animal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do shut up,” said William irritably, “carryin’
on jus’ as if nothin’ ever turned out right.”</p>

<p>“Well, nothin’ ever does,” said Douglas, hotly
defending his pessimism. “Look at the time you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, both of you shut up,” said Ginger, “an’ let’s
go an’ fetch the dormouse.”</p>

<p>They passed the drawing-room where Ethel sat with
George on one side of her and Hector on the other.
To be quite frank Ethel was a minx who, while remaining
always provokingly heart-whole, liked to have as
many admirers as possible around her.</p>

<p>Silence and a certain depression fell on the group as
the younger brothers of it passed the window.</p>

<p>“He drove me half mad with a beastly mouth-organ
yesterday,” groaned George, “till I took it from
him and chucked it into the pond.”</p>

<p>“Same here with a trumpet,” said Hector, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
added severely, “seems to me extraordinary what
boys are like nowadays. I’m quite sure <i>we</i> were never
like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure no boy ever anywhere was half as
bad as William,” said Ethel with a sigh. “He broke
a vase that was one of my greatest treasures yesterday
with his bow and arrow. He really <i>is</i> the worst of
the lot.”</p>

<p>Both Hector and George made an inarticulate
murmur that might either have been half-hearted
protest or deep sympathy, but neither of them seriously
disputed the statement.</p>

<p>“Ginger’s pretty bad, though,” said Hector with a
judicial air; “last week he had one of those awful things
that are supposed to sound like a dog barking.”</p>

<p>“William had a thing,” said Ethel dreamily, “that
was supposed to sound like a bird chirping only it
didn’t. It sounded like—well, I don’t know what
it sounded like, but it went through and <i>through</i> my
head.”</p>

<p>“What a <i>shame</i>,” said Hector and George simultaneously
in passionate indignation. Their tone
implied that they were lusting for William’s blood.</p>

<p>“After all,” continued Ethel happily, burbling on
in the serene consciousness that it didn’t really matter
what she said because every single word of it would
be heavenly wisdom in the ears of the infatuated
youths, “after all a bird’s chirp is quite a nice soft
sound. I’m very fond of birds.”</p>

<p>“What sort do you like best?” said George and
Hector simultaneously. They glared at each other
suspiciously as they spoke. Each had decided to give
Ethel a present of her favourite bird in as ornamental
a cage as his means would allow on her next birthday,
and each had a horrible suspicion that the other had
the same project in mind.</p>

<p>“I think that parrots are rather sweet,” said Ethel.
“Don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Neither spoke, because neither did consider parrots
rather sweet and both were having sudden misgivings
about the price of parrots.... Didn’t parrots cost
an awful lot of money—a matter of pounds, unless,
of course, one could meet a sailor just returned from
foreign parts with one, and probably even he would
demand its market price. A canary now ... both
had hoped she’d say a canary. Both had had pleasing
visions of themselves presenting Ethel with a very
yellow canary in a very ornate cage adorned with a
very blue bow ... the vision included Ethel’s delight,
her cries of rapture, her sudden realisation that nowhere
else would she meet with such tenderness, such understanding,
such undying devotion as in this hero who
remembered even what sort of bird she liked best,
who—anyway, it was all very romantic and there
was a beautiful wedding and they lived happily ever
after. When the canary was dead, of course, she had
it stuffed and it was always one of her dearest treasures.
But a parrot ... no, one could never wax sentimental
over a parrot. A parrot would never surely inaugurate
a romance.</p>

<p>“You can teach it such jolly things to say,” went
on Ethel. “I remember once a friend of mine had to
go into quarantine for measles or something like that
and a friend of hers gave her a parrot to be company
for her. He gave it her in rather a nice way, too.
He put it on the garden seat on the lawn and sent in
a letter to say that if she would look out of her window
she would see a little friend who had come to keep
her company. Or something like that. She was
always devoted to that parrot.”</p>

<p>Both George and Hector checked an impulse to
ask whether she married him. Each would have
asked it had the other not been present, but there are
certain questions which are more effective when asked
without an audience. George and Hector walked
home together but in silence. The only thing they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
wanted to talk about was Ethel, but they didn’t want
to talk about Ethel to each other. Hector decided
that if George won her he would go out to Africa to
shoot big game. George, being of a less subtle nature,
had decided that if Hector won her he would drown
himself in the village pond. But neither was really
uneasy because neither thought that the other would
win her. After all, thought George, she hadn’t
looked at Hector in that meaning way she’d looked at
him when she said good-bye, and, after all, thought
Hector, she hadn’t pressed George’s hand as she’d
pressed his on parting....</p>

<p>They met the Outlaws on their way to William’s
house reverently carrying among them what was to
be the star turn of the lecture, Ginger’s dormouse.</p>

<p>The Outlaws and Ethel’s suitors looked at each
other coldly and without recognition as they passed,
but really the Outlaws had the best of the encounter
because they could turn round and make grimaces
expressive of scorn and derision at the back of their
foes, and because they knew that their foes had an
uneasy suspicion that they were doing this but considered
it inconsistent with their dignity to look back
to make sure.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was the next morning. Ethel was staring wildly
at a letter she held in her hand.</p>

<p>“Daphne’s got measles and I was with her last
night. What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to go into quarantine, I’m afraid,
dear,” said her mother placidly.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” said Ethel in a tone of horror and
despair, and feeling the exclamation inadequate,
changed it to “Great Heavens!”</p>

<p>After a pause indicative of deep feeling she continued:
“Why, only yesterday I was telling George
and Hector about the time Lucy Foxe had it and
what’s-his-name sent her a parrot. It seems as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
just mentioning the thing had brought it on me. Well,
I shall die of boredom, that’s all. Do you mean to
say that I’ve got to stay in the room <i>all</i> the time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said her mother and added placidly,
“there’s quite a nice view.”</p>

<p>Ethel went to the window. From it she could see
Ginger, Douglas and William clustered round the
dormouse’s cage by the side of the lawn.</p>

<p>“<i>That’s</i> a lovely view, isn’t it?” she said bitterly.</p>

<p>William had received the news that Ethel would
have to be in quarantine for measles without emotion
or indeed without interest of any sort. He had no
time or thought or sympathy to spare for Ethel. A
more terrible tragedy had happened than Ethel’s
quarantine. The dormouse had died in the night.
There was no sign to show how it had died. It was
certainly not starvation. It had died in the midst
of plenty. There were no marks of violence on the
body. Douglas had a theory that some of the berries
picked promiscuously in the garden for its nourishment
yesterday by Ginger from any tree or bush that
provided berries of any sort had not agreed with it.
Ginger hotly contested this theory.</p>

<p>“That’s what berries are <i>for</i>,” he said indignantly.
“That’s what Nachur provides berries on trees for—to
feed animals with.”</p>

<p>William interrupted the discussion to suggest that
as long as hygiene should allow, the dead body of the
dormouse should be exhibited as a stuffed one. “No
one’ll know it isn’t,” he added hopefully, “not without
cuttin’ it open and we won’t let ’em do that. We’ll
jus’ say it’s a stuffed dormouse an’ I’ll talk about it
a bit, tellin’ about its habits—sleepin’ an’ such like,
an’ p’r’aps it won’t be so bad.”</p>

<p>His optimism was unconvinced and unconvincing.
He knew that no stuffed dormouse could compensate
for the sight of Ginger’s dormouse going round and
round on its little wheel. They took the dead body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
to the summer-house, leaving William alone on the
lawn gloomily considering the prospects of his lecture
thus deprived of its star turn.</p>

<p>He did not at first see Ginger’s brother Hector who
had come round to the side of the house looking pale
and distraught.</p>

<p>“This is terrible news,” began Hector.</p>

<p>William was touched. Somehow he hadn’t expected
this kindness, this understanding, from Hector.</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it,” he acquiesced despondently,
“terrible.”</p>

<p>“She seemed all right yesterday,” continued Hector.</p>

<p>“She was,” affirmed William, “she was quite all
right yesterday. I think it was eatin’ those berries.”</p>

<p>“What berries?” said the young man.</p>

<p>“Those berries Ginger gave her.”</p>

<p>“D—did Ginger give her some berries?” stammered
Hector aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes—all sorts of different coloured kinds of berries
what he found about the garden. And she ate them
all.”</p>

<p>The horror of the young man is indescribable.
That <i>his</i> young brother—<i>his</i> young brother should be
the cause of it....</p>

<p>“B-but,” he stammered, “I—I heard in the village
it was measles.”</p>

<p>“No,” said William, “it’s worse than measles.
She’s dead. She died in the night.”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>” screamed the young man.</p>

<p>“She’s dead,” said William, somewhat flattered if
a little surprised by the deep emotion shown by the
visitor. “When Ginger ’n’ me came to clean out her
cage this mornin’ we found her dead.”</p>

<p>“Clean out her c——! What the dickens are you
talking about?”</p>

<p>“Our mouse,” said William simply; “weren’t you?”</p>

<p>The visitor obviously controlled himself with an
effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“No,” he said with venomous coldness, “I was
talking about your sister Ethel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ethel——” said William carelessly. “Oh no,
it’s not measles. It’s somethin’ else. I’ve forgotten
its name.”</p>

<p>Again anxiety clouded the young man’s brow.</p>

<p>“N-nothing serious, I hope?” he said.</p>

<p>“Dunno,” said William, “might be, I suppose. I
simply can’t understand it dyin’ like that. I mean
I’ve always thought that if berries were pois’nous,
an’mals din’ eat them. I always thought that an’mals
had some special way of tellin’ pois’nous stuff.”</p>

<p>Again the young man restrained himself with
difficulty from inflicting actual physical injury upon
William.</p>

<p>“Is your sister allowed visitors?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ethel?” said William as if bringing his mind with
an effort from an affair of vital and universal importance
to one of no significance at all. “No. She’s got the
sort of illness that she’s not ill with, but she’s not got
to see people. It’s got a name but I’ve forgot it.
It looked all right last night. It ate Ginger’s berries
about six o’clock an’ it looked all right when we left
it. If you want to know what <i>I</i> think, I think that
someone’s poisoned it. I think——”</p>

<p>“You mean she’s in quarantine?” interrupted
Ginger’s brother Hector.</p>

<p>“No,” said William irritably, “I keep tellin’ you—she’s
dead.”</p>

<p>“Shut up about your beastly mouse,” commanded
Ginger’s brother Hector fiercely. “I don’t care two
pins for your beastly mouse——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t, don’t you?” muttered William
darkly.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. It’s your sister I’m talking about.
You mean that she’s in quarantine.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William, “that’s the name of what she’s
got. Dun’t seem to have made much difference to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
her ’cept makin’ her temper a bit worse than usual
and that’s sayin’ <i>somethin’</i>.”</p>

<p>Hector turned on his heel contemptuously and
strode away, his brow drawn into a thoughtful frown.
He’d remembered suddenly what Ethel had said about
the parrot. He’d get a parrot. He’d write a note such
as she said her friend’s friend had written about a
little friend to keep her company, and leave the parrot
in the garden as her friend’s friend had done. She
had seemed to think it was a beautiful thought. He’d
do it ... it would, he was sure, touch her deeply.
If only that wretched fellow George didn’t think of
it too. He’d hurry home and do it quickly before
George thought of it. He met George on the road,
acknowledged him with distant hauteur and passed
on his way.</p>

<p>William remained upon the garden bench plunged
in gloom. The death of the dormouse had imperilled
all his plans. He felt that he could have lectured
indefinitely upon the dormouse as it went round and
round on its little wheel or even as it blinked at them
or ate its food, but a stiff, dead dormouse even
camouflaged as a “stuffed” exhibit was quite a
different affair. It would, he was afraid, fall very
flat indeed. But William was never the boy to own
himself beaten. He was searching about in his mind
for some other exhibit to take the place of the live
dormouse when the shadow of George fell upon him
and the voice of George broke upon his meditations.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m very sorry to hear this,” began George.</p>

<p>William’s heart warmed to him. Here, at any rate,
was sympathy....</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “it was an awful shock to us all to
find her dead this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>” screamed George.</p>

<p>Explanation followed. It appeared that George
also did not care two pins about the beastly mouse,
and they parted coldly. George walked quickly down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the road. He’d suddenly remembered what Ethel
had said about the parrot yesterday. He’d get her
one.... He’d give it her in the same way as she
said that her friend’s friend had given one to her.
She’d seemed to think that there was something very
graceful about it. It would please her. He’d hurry
home now so as to do it before Hector thought of
it....</p>

<p>William rejoined the others in the summer-house.</p>

<p>“Takin’ your mouth-organs an’ trumpets off you,”
he said bitterly, “an’ carin’ more about someone
bein’ ill than someone <i>dyin’</i>. An’ she’s not even
reely ill, either. If I get a chance,” he added darkly,
“I’ll make ’em buy you <i>new</i> mouth-organs an’ trumpets,
an’ make her give me back my bow an’ arrer.”</p>

<p>“Well, you aren’t likely to get a chance,” said the
victims without much gratitude, “an’ the thing to do
now is to try’n find a few more animals for lecturin’
on. A dead dormouse an’ a few insecks isn’t much.”</p>

<p>William considered this a minute in silence, then he
said:</p>

<p>“Tell you what. We’ll put up a notice askin’
people to lend us an’mals or give us an’mals like what
they do to the Zoo.”</p>

<p>This suggestion seemed to infuse new life into them.
Their gloom departed.</p>

<p>“Who’ll write it an’ where’ll we put it?” said
Ginger.</p>

<p>“I’ll write it,” said William, “an’ we’ll put it on
the side gate-post. Quite a lot of people go along the
lane by the side gate. We’ll put it up an’ then we’ll
go out’n look for some more int’restin’ insecks.”</p>

<p>“If we all go out,” objected Ginger, “there’ll be no
one to take the an’mals when they bring them.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws tried to visualise a queue of people
waiting by the side gate each in charge of a rare and
interesting animal, but even to their optimism the
vision lacked reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Of course,” admitted William, “it’s jus’ <i>possible</i>
that no one’ll see it—at least no one what’s got an
an’mal or at least no one what’s got an an’mal what
they want to lend us. It doesn’t hardly seem worth
while any of us stayin’ behind jus’ on the chance
when we might be out catchin’ int’restin’ insecks.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put somethin’ on the notice,” suggested
Ginger, “tellin’ ’em to take ’em to the summer-house
an’ leave ’em there.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William sarcastically, “an’ havin’ ’em
eatin’ up or fightin’ our insecks. You don’ know
what sort of wild creatures they may bring—all
fightin’ each other an’ eatin’ each other up in the
summer-house. ’Sides, you can see the summer-house
from the road an’ we’ll be gettin’ ’em all stolen by
thieves what see them as they pass. No, I vote we
shut up the summer-house while we’re away an’
put somethin’ on the notice tellin’ ’em where to leave
them. They can leave ’em somewhere where they
can’t be seen from the road.” He pondered the
problem in silence for a few seconds, frowning thoughtfully,
then his face cleared. “I know ... we’ll tell
’em to put ’em on the seat in the back garden, ’cause
no one can see that from the road an’ if it’s somethin’
wild they can tie it up.”</p>

<p>This seemed to the Outlaws an excellent solution
of the problem, and William went indoors to write out
the notice. Soon he emerged carrying it and wearing
the complacent smile of successful authorship.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” he said with modest pride. “All right,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>They gathered round to look. It read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“mister william brown is going to lekcher on
anmals and will be gratful to anyone who will give
or lend him anmals to be lekchered on mister
william brown will take grate care of them mister
william brown is out now lookin for valubul insex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
but will be back before dinner mister william brown
will be glad if people givin him anmals to be
lekchered on will put them on the seat in the back
garden an tie them up if they are savvidge anmals

anmals should have cages as mister william browns
father will be mad with him if dammidge is done
to the garden by wild anmals lent or given him
for his lekcher if anmals are lent him will they
kinly have a label with the address of their home
so as mister william brown the lekcherer on anmals
may bring them home after they have been lekchered
on things like hedgehogs or porkquipines must be
fetched mister william brown is a very interestin
lekcherer an anyone may kinly come an listen to
him who likes if the summer-house is full peple
may come an look at him thru the window.”</p>
</div>

<p>The other Outlaws were less impressed by this
than was its author. Ginger voiced their feelings.</p>

<p>“Good deal about you in it,” he commented, “an’
not much about us.”</p>

<p>“Well, who’s the lecturer?” demanded William with
spirit, “me or you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ginger, “an’ who works jus’ as hard as
you <i>or</i> harder gettin’ things ready?”</p>

<p>William soothed their feelings by adding a footnote
to his notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“mister william browns vallubal assistunts are
ginger and douglas.”</p>
</div>

<p>Conciliated by this they helped William to pin the
notice on the side gate and sallied forth with him in
search of insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

</figure>

<p>A short time before their return, Hector appeared
looking very hot and breathless. He held a parrot
in a cage. He had cycled frenziedly into the nearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
town for it and he had spent practically his last penny
on it. He came round to the back of the house.
Ethel’s window was, he believed, at the back of the
house. There he found a garden seat conveniently
situated. He put the parrot upon that and tiptoed
to the side door. He had decided to do the whole
graceful action as Ethel’s friend’s friend had done it.
If Ethel was touched at second hand, as it were, by
the action as performed by her friend’s friend, how
much more would she be touched when it was actually
done to her.</p>

<p>He slipped a letter quietly through the letter-box.
In the letter he said that if she would look out of the
window she would see upon the garden seat a little
friend who had come to keep her company. Then,
still hot and breathless, but smiling fatuously to
himself, he tiptoed away.</p>

<p>Hardly had he disappeared when the Outlaws
returned. The expedition had not been, upon the
whole, a great success. They had only found one
species of caterpillar that William did not already
possess. They carried it carefully in a little tin which
contained also a large amount of greenery for its
nourishment.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve not found <i>much</i>,” said Douglas
despondently.</p>

<p>“No,” said William, “but—but someone might’ve
brought an animal for us while we’ve been away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ they mightn’t,” said Douglas. “I bet
you anythin’ that we find that ole garden seat as empty
as we left it.”</p>

<p>“An’ I bet we find somethin’ put on it,” said
William with gallant but unconvinced optimism.</p>

<p>They turned the corner of the house and stood there
transfixed for a moment with rapture and amazement.</p>

<p>There upon the garden seat was a parrot in a cage.</p>

<p>Recovering from their paralysis they rushed to it
and bore it off in triumph to the summer-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“<i>Well</i>,” said William deeply touched and with his
faith in human nature entirely restored. “I do call
that decent of <i>somebody</i>.”</p>

<p>“An’ no label on,” said Ginger, “that means we
can keep it. They’ve <i>given</i> it.”</p>

<p>They crowded round their acquisition, still half
incredulous of their amazing good fortune.</p>

<p>“Someone must’ve come down the lane an’ seen
the notice,” said William, “an’ then gone home to
fetch their parrot to give us. P’raps it’d belonged to
some relation what’d died an’ they din’t know what
to do with it or p’raps”—hopefully—“it uses such
bad language that they din’t like to have it in the
house.”</p>

<p>As if intensely amused by the idea the parrot
uttered a shrill scream of laughter and when its
paroxysm of mirth was over said with deep feeling:
“Go away. I hate you.”</p>

<p>This so delighted the Outlaws that they crowded
round it again hoping it would repeat it, but though
it would whistle and make the sound of a cork coming
out of a bottle and utter a most offensive snigger, it
refused to oblige the Outlaws by telling them again
that it hated them.</p>

<p>“Wonder what they eat,” said Ginger still gazing
enraptured at their new pet.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you start givin’ it any of your berries,”
said William sternly. Then looking round: “I say,
where’s that tin with my caterpillar in? Who’s took
it?”</p>

<p>“You left it on the garden seat when we fetched the
parrot in,” said Douglas, “I saw you.”</p>

<p>They hurried out to the garden seat.</p>

<p>It was empty.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the <i>cheek</i>,” said William indignantly,
“someone’s pinched it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind it,” said Ginger, “we’ve got a parrot.
What’s a caterpillar when we’ve got a parrot?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“I <i>want</i> that caterpillar,” said William doggedly,
“I’d thought of a lot of things to say about it an’
I’m goin’ to get another. Come on. Let’s shut up
the parrot in the summer-house where no one can steal
it an’ all go out to look for another caterpillar.”</p>

<p>Without much enthusiasm they agreed.</p>

<p>“An’ what I’d like to know,” said William darkly,
“is where that caterpillar <i>is</i>.”</p>

<p>That caterpillar was as a matter of fact in Ethel’s
bedroom, being flung, tin box and all, into the fireplace
in a fit of temper. A housemaid had found Hector’s
note on the mat and taken it up to Ethel’s room.
Ethel’s room did not happen to overlook the garden.
She read the note with a smile almost as fatuous as
Hector’s. She remembered what she had told them
about the parrot. Suppose he’d remembered the
story and brought her a parrot. “A little friend to
keep you company.” ... It might, of course, be a
kitten or a puppy.... Anyway, it was very, very
sweet of him. She opened her door and, still smiling,
called to the housemaid who was sweeping the stairs.</p>

<p>“Emma, will you go out and bring me something
that you’ll find upon the garden seat.”</p>

<p>Emma went out and returned with a small tin.
Ethel’s smile faded.</p>

<p>“Was this all that there was upon the garden seat?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. There was nothing else.”</p>

<p>Ethel returned to her room and opened the tin.
Inside were several leaves and a big furry caterpillar.
There was nothing else.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>that’s</i> his idea of being funny, is it?” said
Ethel viciously. “Well, it’s not <i>mine</i>.”</p>

<p>And it was then that she flung the tin furiously
into the fireplace.</p>

<p>At that very moment had she but known it, the
faithful George was tiptoeing softly round the house
bearing a parrot in a cage. He too was hot and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
breathless. He too had cycled into the neighbouring
market town for the parrot. He too had spent
practically his last penny on it. He too had decided
to leave it on the garden seat and drop into the letter-box
a note about a “little friend to keep her company.”
He entered the back garden. There was a convenient
garden seat. He put down the cage upon it, slipped
his note into the letter-box and went home smiling to
himself. How pleased she’d be about it.... It
would give him a pull over that ass Hector. Near
the gate he met the Outlaws carrying a tin. They
passed each other as usual without any sign of
recognition. Both Ginger and Hector and Douglas
and George, whatever stage of cordiality or the reverse
their relations might have attained at home, made it
a point of honour to pass each other on the public
highway as if they had never seen each other before.
At present relations at home were not cordial.</p>

<p>“Smilin’,” muttered Douglas bitterly when he
had passed. “Yes, ’s all right for <i>him</i> to go about
smilin’—takin’ people’s mouth-organs off them an’
ru’nin’ them.”</p>

<p>“Funny we only caught one of those caterpillars
again,” said William meditatively.</p>

<p>“Well, one’s enough to lecture on, I suppose,”
said Douglas rather irritably. The sight of the
fatuously smiling George had reminded him of his
grievances. “I’d like to see someone take somethin’
of <i>his</i> away,” he went on, little knowing how literally
his wish was to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>“An’ I’d saved up for that trumpet,” said Ginger.
“I don’t s’pose I’ll ever—what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>William, who was walking in front, had stopped
suddenly on turning the corner of the house and was
staring in blank amazement, eyes and mouth wide open.</p>

<p>“There—there’s another parrot on the seat,” he
said faintly. “Seems—seems sort of impossible but—look!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>They looked. Like William’s, their eyes and
mouths opened wide in blank amazement.</p>

<p>“It is, isn’t it?” said William still faintly as if
he couldn’t quite believe his eyes. “It <i>is</i> another
parrot, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ginger also rather faintly, “it cert’nly is.
Someone else must’ve passed the notice. Seems sort of
funny they should <i>all</i> be givin’ us parrots, dun’t it?”</p>

<p>With a certain dazed bewilderment beneath their
ecstasy the Outlaws approached this new “gift.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take it in the summer-house an’ see if it
talks to the other,” said William.</p>

<p>They took it into the summer-house and the other
parrot greeted it with a sardonic laugh. The latest
comer gazed round the summer-house with a supercilious
air and finally ejaculated “Great Scott!”</p>

<p>Ginger drew a breath of delight but William, in
whom familiarity with parrots was breeding contempt
and who was becoming over critical, merely said, “If
that’s the worst bad language it knows it’s not goin’
to be very int’restin’.” Then he looked about him.
“Where’s that tin with the caterpillar in?”</p>

<p>“You left it on the bench again, William;” said
Douglas.</p>

<p>They went out and stood around the empty bench.</p>

<p>“<i>Well</i>,” said William “it’s—it’s mos’ <i>mysterious</i>.
Someone’s pinched <i>this</i> one too.”</p>

<p>Upstairs Ethel was hurling the second caterpillar
and tin furiously into the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Very funny, aren’t they?” she was saying. “‘A
little friend to keep you company.’ And two caterpillars.
Oh, yes, it’s a <i>great</i> joke, isn’t it. All <i>right</i>,
my young friends, all <i>right</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, all I can say <i>is</i>,” William was saying, “that
it’s one of the mos’ <i>mysterious</i> things what’ve ever
happened to me in all my life. Two parrots give me
an’ two tins of caterpillars stole off me in the same
mornin’ ... but ’s no good goin’ out to find another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
now. There’s not time. We’ll jus’ have to have the
lecture without it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was late afternoon. Hector, still wearing his
fatuous smile, came round the corner of the house.
He’d expected a note of thanks before now. He felt
that he couldn’t wait a minute longer without hearing
an account of Ethel’s rapturous glee on the receipt
of his present. He could imagine it, of course, but
he wanted to hear someone telling him about it.
“She was delighted” ... “So kind of you” ...
“She was <i>deeply</i> touched” ... “She’s writing to you
now” ... “She’s longing for the time when her
quarantine will be over and she can see you and thank
you properly,” ... were a few of the phrases that
occurred to him....</p>

<p>A housemaid opened the door.</p>

<p>“I just—er—called to see if the parrot was settling
down all right,” said Hector in an ingratiating manner.</p>

<p>“The parrot?” said the housemaid in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, the parrot that arrived this morning.”</p>

<p>“No parrot arrived this morning, sir,” said the
housemaid.</p>

<p>It was Hector’s turn to be surprised.</p>

<p>“W-what?” he said, “are—are you sure.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, sir,” said the housemaid. “There’s no
parrot in the house at all.”</p>

<p>“Not—er—not in Miss Brown’s room,” said Hector
desperately.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’ve just been there.”</p>

<p>Dazedly Hector walked away. Of course the thing
was as plain as daylight. What a fool he’d been to
leave the thing out there on the seat. Some tramp
had come back to the back door and run off with it.
And he’d spent all the money he’d got on it....
Wasn’t it the <i>rottenest</i>—— He stopped and stared.
He’d wandered disconsolately round to the other side
of the house and there, just outside the closed door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of the summer-house, stood William with a parrot in
a cage.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The lecture was over. The Outlaws had collected
a small and unruly audience of children who’d nothing
else to do but no one had enjoyed it except William,
who had lectured to his own entire satisfaction and
was now feeling tired and hoarse. He was, moreover,
beginning to find his parrots more of a liability than
an asset. All attempts at closer acquaintance with
them had been resisted so promptly that both Ginger
and Douglas had had to improvise bandages for
bleeding fingers from very grimy handkerchiefs,
and William’s nose had been bitten almost in two
while he was gazing fondly at his new possessions
through the bars. Also there was the economic side
of the question to consider. William had been down
to the village to ascertain the price of parrot food and
had come back aghast at the result.</p>

<p>“We simply can’t afford to keep ’em,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I know I can’t. I’d have nothin’ left for
myself at all out of the bit of pocket money they
give me.”</p>

<p>“Can’t they live on scraps an’ things?” said
Ginger.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said William, “I guess you’d like to try
feedin’ ’em on pois’nous berries same as what you did
the dormouse.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was mine, wasn’t it?” said Ginger with
spirit.</p>

<p>“Yes, but <i>this</i> isn’t,” said William, “this was given
me to lecture on an’ I’m not goin’ to have it killed
with pois’nous berries by you.”</p>

<p>“What are you goin’ to do with it, then?” said
Ginger, “if you say you can’t buy it proper food?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet,” said William irritably.</p>

<p>Like most other lecturers he was suffering the
reaction from his expenditure of eloquence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>At this point the two parrots began to hold a
screaming contest till William was forced to take
George’s outside and close the door, whereupon the
clamour died down. It was at this moment that
Hector came round the corner of the house. His first
impulse was to hurl himself upon William and accuse
him of stealing his parrot. But on approaching nearer
he saw that it was not his parrot. It was not his
parrot and it was not his cage. His expression
changed. He approached William in a manner that
can only be described as ingratiating.</p>

<p>“Whose is that parrot, William?” he asked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Mine,” said William shortly.</p>

<p>“W-where did you get it?” said Hector still more
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Someone gave it to me,” said William.</p>

<p>There was a short silence, then Hector said slowly:</p>

<p>“I was just wanting a parrot like that.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” said William.</p>

<p>Hector cleared his throat and then said in a manner
that was more ingratiating than ever:</p>

<p>“They’re rather dangerous, you know, and very
expensive to feed.”</p>

<p>William secretly agreed with both these statements,
but he gave no sign of having even heard them. A
shade of nervousness crept into Hector’s ingratiating
manner.</p>

<p>“I—I’m willing to buy that parrot from you,
William,” he offered.</p>

<p>William turned a steady eye upon him.</p>

<p>“How much for?” he said sternly.</p>

<p>Hector hesitated. He hadn’t any money to speak
of. With a different type of child, of course, one
might—— He’d always disliked William far more
than the other Outlaws.</p>

<p>“They’re not expensive things, of course,” he said
carelessly, hoping that William did not know their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
value, “and they’re a lot of trouble. One must take
into account that they’re delicate birds and one has
to——”</p>

<p>William interrupted. A sudden gleam had come
into William’s eye.</p>

<p>“I tell you what I’ll do,” he said, “I’ll swop it with
you.”</p>

<p>“What for?” said Hector hopefully.</p>

<p>The gleam in William’s eye became brighter, more
steely.</p>

<p>“I want to give Ginger a present,” he said carelessly.
“I want to give him one of those nice trumpets. The
<i>very</i> nice ones. You can get ’em at Foley’s in the
village. They cost six shillings. I’ll swop it with
you for one of those trumpets to give to Ginger.”</p>

<p>William’s freckled face was absolutely expressionless
as he made this offer. For a minute there was murder
in Hector’s eye. He went purple, controlled himself
with an effort, then after a minute’s silence full of
unspoken words, gulped and said:</p>

<p>“Very well. You wait here.”</p>

<p>Soon he was back with the trumpet. He hurled it
at William with a gesture of anger and contempt,
seized the parrot cage and disappeared. He was
going to take it home, write a beautiful little note,
fasten it to the ring, and deliver it in person at the
front door. He wasn’t going to repeat his mistake of
leaving it anywhere where it could be stolen before
it reached the beloved’s hands.</p>

<p>Inside the summer-house the Outlaws were dancing
a dance of exultation and triumph around Ginger
who was producing loud but discordant strains from
his magnificent new trumpet.</p>

<p>This festive gathering was, however, broken by
the sudden advent of George who, like Hector, had not
been able to resist the temptation of coming round
to receive a detailed description of Ethel’s delight.
Like Hector he had been informed that no parrot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
had entered the house that day. He had then caught
a glimpse of the Outlaws in the summer-house leaping
wildly about a parrot in a cage to the mingled strains
of some devilish musical instrument and the shrill
sardonic chuckles of a parrot. He hurled himself in
upon them in fury.</p>

<p>“You little <i>thieves</i>,” he panted, seizing William by
both ears. “What do you <i>mean</i> by taking my
parrot?”</p>

<p>William firmly but with great dignity freed his ears,
then as firmly and with as much dignity replied:</p>

<p>“’S not your parrot. ’S ours.”</p>

<p>George looked at the parrot and his jaw dropped.
William was right. It wasn’t his parrot. It wasn’t
his cage.</p>

<p>He gulped. His anger departed. A certain
propitiatory note came into his voice as he began to
make tentative enquiries as to the exact value William
set upon his parrot. It appeared that though William
valued his parrot very highly indeed, still in order to
oblige George he was willing to exchange it for a
mouth-organ, one of the six-shilling ones from Foley’s,
because he happened to want to give one to Douglas
as a present. George, after displaying all the symptoms
of an imminent apoplectic fit, went off to buy the
mouth-organ, returned with it, flung it furiously at the
Outlaws and stalked off with his parrot.</p>

<p>William turned to the other Outlaws.</p>

<p>“I mus’ say,” he admitted, “that a lot of extraordinary
things seem to be hap’nin’ to us to-day.
People givin’ away parrots an’ other people wantin’
’em an’—let’s go’n’ see what he’s goin’ to do with it.”</p>

<p>At a discreet distance they followed George round
and out of the side gate. George was going to take
the parrot in at the front door, ring the bell, and
deliver it in person. He wasn’t going to run the risk
of having it stolen a second time.... And then, to
his amazement, he saw Hector blithely approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
from the opposite direction also carrying a parrot
in a cage. Hector had been home, had written a
graceful little note, attached it to the ring of the cage,
and was now coming to present it to Ethel. They met
at the gate. Their mouths slowly opened. Their
eyes bulged in fury and amazement as each recognised
his own parrot and cage in the hand of the other.
Simultaneously they shouted “So <i>you</i> stole my parrot.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws watched in mystified delight. A
shabby-looking man who happened to be passing also
stopped to form an interested audience.</p>

<p>“It’s not your parrot ... I say <i>you</i> stole mine.”</p>

<p>“I did <i>not</i> ... <i>that’s</i> my parrot you’re holding.”</p>

<p>“You heard her say she’d like a parrot and you——”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t afford one yourself so you pinched
mine and——”</p>

<p>“A jolly good thing I’ve caught you——”</p>

<p>“I did <i>not</i>——”</p>

<p>“You <i>did</i>——”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar and a thief.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. You are.”</p>

<p>“I’m what?”</p>

<p>“A liar and a thief.”</p>

<p>“Say that again.”</p>

<p>“A liar and a thief.”</p>

<p>“Are you referring to me or to you?”</p>

<p>“To you.”</p>

<p>“Well, say it again.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar and a thief.”</p>

<p>Feeling words inadequate, but finding the cage he
was carrying an impediment to threatening gestures,
George turned round, thrust it into William’s arms with
a curt “take that,” and began to roll up his sleeves.
Hector turned to the shabby-looking man, who stood
just behind him, thrust his cage into his arms, and
began to roll up his sleeves. The next minute George
and Hector, who attended the same boxing class and
knew each other’s style by heart, were giving a splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
display upon the high road, with bare fists. From
the <i>mélange</i> came at regular intervals the words
“thief” and “liar,” “you did,” “I didn’t.”</p>

<p>It was clear that in the shabby-looking man’s breast
there raged a struggle between duty and pleasure—the
pleasure of watching the fight and the duty of
providing for himself the necessities of life. Duty
won, and he crept softly away with his parrot and
cage, and was never seen or heard of in that locality
again.</p>

<p>William stood for a minute deep in thought, then
went quietly indoors with his parrot and cage, leaving
Hector and George still deaf and blind to everything
but the joy of fighting.</p>

<p>William, still very thoughtful, carried his cage up
to Ethel’s room.</p>

<p>“I won’t come in, Ethel,” he said softly, “’cause
of catching your quarantine illness, but I’ve brought
you a little present. I heard you’d said you’d like
a parrot an’ I’ve brought you one.”</p>

<p>Ethel and his mother came to the door and stared
at him in amazement. Freckled, stern, inscrutable,
he handed the cage to Ethel.</p>

<p>“B-but wherever did you get it, William?” said
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“A man gave it me,” said William.</p>

<p>“A <i>man</i> gave it you?” gasped Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William, his face and voice entirely
devoid of any expression. “A man in the road gave
it me. He just put it in my arms an’ said: ‘Take
that.’ He gave it me.”</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” gasped Mrs. Brown, “isn’t that <i>extraordinary</i>!
But there <i>are</i> a lot of eccentric people
about and”—vaguely—“one’s always reading of queer
things in the newspapers.”</p>

<p>Ethel was deeply touched. That William should
bring his present straight to her. That it should be
William who remembered her lightly expressed wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
for a parrot which those two—well, there weren’t
any words strong enough for them—had only
ridiculed.... She felt drawn to William as never
before.</p>

<p>“How—how <i>very</i> kind of you, William,” she said.
“I—you can have your bow and arrow back. I’m
sorry I took it from you. It’s—it’s <i>very</i> kind of you
to bring me the parrot.”</p>

<p>William received his bow and arrow with perfunctory
thanks. Just at that moment the housemaid came up
with a note. Ethel tore it open.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s all right,” she said. “Daphne hasn’t
got measles after all. The rash has all gone, and the
doctor says she’s not got it at all, and they want me
to go to tea, and they’ve got that artist coming—you
know, the one that said that I was the loveliest girl
he’d ever seen in his life, and—— Oh, how jolly.
I’ll start at once.”</p>

<p>“May Douglas and Ginger and me walk with you
just as far as there, Ethel?” said William.</p>

<p>“Certainly, William,” said Ethel in her melted mood.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Ethel, accompanied by William,
Ginger and Douglas, set out from the front door.
William carried his bow and arrow, Ginger his magnificent
new trumpet, and Douglas his magnificent
new mouth-organ. They walked very jauntily.</p>

<p>At the gate Hector and George came forward to
greet them. The fight was just over. It had been
indecisive. They were equally matched and knew
each other’s style of boxing too well ever to be taken
by surprise, so the fight had finally been abandoned
by mutual consent. At the unexpected sight of
Ethel emerging from the front door escorted by the
Outlaws, they pulled themselves together and hastened
forward with smiles of greeting. Ethel passed them
head in air without any sign of recognition. They
stood gaping after her in helpless bewilderment.
The Outlaws turned back to look at them, Ginger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
Douglas raised trumpet and mouth-organ to their
lips and uttered defiant strains, William waved his
bow and arrow in careless greeting, then they turned
back and went on their way accompanying Ethel, an
indescribable swagger in their walk.</p>

<p>George and Hector picked up their hats from the
dust and walked slowly away in the opposite direction.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Ethel wasn’t in quarantine after all. And she was
going out to tea to meet the artist who said she
was the loveliest girl he’d ever seen in his life. She
was tired to death of those two boys but—but it was
all right now.</p>

<p>She was perfectly happy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Outlaws had got back their confiscated property,
and then some, as they say across the Atlantic. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
had scored most gloriously off their enemies. They
had had a most successful day. There had been, it
is true, certain mysterious elements in it that they
could not understand, but that did not matter. It
had been a most successful day. They were perfectly
happy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>George and Hector walked down the road arm in
arm. Their conflict had stimulated them and roused
again all their old friendship. They were confiding
in each other that women were unreliable and incalculable
and that it was best to give them a wide berth.
They were congratulating each other on the narrow
escape from the lifelong unhappiness that marriage
with Ethel would have meant to them.</p>

<p>Then they went on to discuss the latest football
results.</p>

<p>They were perfectly happy....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER VII</small><br>

ONE GOOD TURN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE atmosphere in William’s home was electric, or,
as William put it, everyone seemed to be in a bait
but him. Uncle Frederick was staying with them,
and not only Uncle Frederick but also a distant
cousin, many times removed, called Flavia. Flavia is
a romantic name, but not as romantic as its owner.
Flavia was tall and slim and dark with deep violet
eyes. Not that William thought her romantic. He
did not even realise that she was tall and slim and dark
with deep violet eyes. To William she was merely an
ordinary and quite unattractive grown-up. He had
tested her intelligence and found it entirely lacking
(she did not, for instance, know the difference between
a Poplar Hawk and a Vaporer, nor did she take the
slightest interest in the records of his prize “conker”).
He felt in her, however, the aloof impersonal interest
he felt for all the girls whom Robert admired. For
Robert admired Flavia. At sight of her he had forgotten
all his other ladye loves (and they had been
numerous), had forgotten even that he had always
intended to marry a small girl with golden hair and
blue eyes, and had gazed on her even while the
introduction was taking place with a lovelorn gaze
that riveted William’s attention at once. William
liked to keep up with Robert’s love affairs, and on
account of their fleeting nature, this was less easy
than it sounds. As he watched the introduction
he mentally transferred the focus of Robert’s affection
from the golden-haired girl he’d been taking on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
river last week to this new arrival. He was on the
whole relieved to find her devoid of intelligence. It
always vaguely shocked him to find intelligence—a
knowledge of insects or interest in conker battles—in
inamoratas of Robert’s. It seemed such a waste
of it.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that the course of true love
would run very smooth indeed with the inamorata
beneath the same roof, but it didn’t. It didn’t because
of Uncle Frederick. Uncle Frederick needed a perpetual
audience. Uncle Frederick accompanied Flavia
and Robert wherever they went. He insisted on
walking in the middle and he talked all the time.
He talked about his stamp collection. He had a
collection of ten thousand stamps, and he was never
perfectly happy except when he was talking about
them. He knew his collection by heart and he could
describe each one of them in detail. He could—in
fact he did—talk about his collection for hours and
hours and hours and hours without stopping. He
took for granted that Robert and Flavia liked to have
him with them wherever they went and so he always
went with them. He went for walks with them. He
went for picnics with them. He went on the river
with them. He went out to tea with them. He
played tennis with them. He sat in the garden with
them. And always he talked to them about his
stamp collection. Sometimes in the evening he read
aloud to them from a book called “The Joy of Stamp
Collecting.”</p>

<p>They were sitting on a seat in the garden—Uncle
Frederick in the middle, Robert and Flavia on either
side.</p>

<p>“I wish you could see it,” Uncle Frederick was
saying; “it’s quite an unique collection. Did I ever
tell you how I got that Japanese stamp?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Robert gloomily.</p>

<p>Robert had an uneasy suspicion that he could see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
William’s face through the laurel bushes, framed in
its feathered Indian head-dress, wearing its unholy grin.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have brought the collection with me,”
went on Uncle Frederick, “but of course it’s very large
and cumbersome. And I’m afraid of thieves. It’s
extraordinary how thieves do get to hear of these
things, and of course they’re very cunning. Did I tell
you about the man I met who’d had a very rare
complete set of Italian stamps taken out of his pocket-book
during a journey without feeling anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Robert.</p>

<p>Uncle Frederick threw him a suspicious glance.
He was almost sure he’d never told Robert that story.
Slightly disconcerted, he paused a minute, then pulling
himself together continued: “I keep them at home
in a specially constructed safe. It would, I think,
baffle any burglar, but of course they are very cunning.
I never come away like this without feeling anxious
about my stamps. The first thing I do when I get
home is to go to my safe and ascertain that they are
all there. Did I ever tell you——” He stopped,
glanced at Robert and began the sentence again. “I
remember hearing of a man once who had a most
valuable collection stolen and faked stamps put in its
stead. It was some months before he discovered the
trick.”</p>

<p>Robert leant over to Flavia who sat serene in the
consciousness of her beauty, and, assuming an
expression which caused much delight to the hidden
William—an expression which soulless people sometimes
compare to that of “a dying duck in a thunderstorm”—said:</p>

<p>“Would you like to come to the summer-house,
Flavia? There’s a very pretty view of the rose
garden from there.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Flavia demurely as she rose.</p>

<p>“You stay here, Uncle Frederick,” said Robert
hastily, seeing that Uncle Frederick, too, was rising,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and added solicitously, “I’m sure you’re tired with
our walk this morning. You rest here while I show
Flavia the view from the summer-house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Uncle Frederick briskly, “I’m not at
all tired; I’m a very good walker. I could outwalk
you both, I dare say. I’ll come and look at this
view from the summer-house with you. I remember
there was a summer-house at home when I was a boy.
I used to take my stamp collection down there to
arrange them. I remember that it was in the old
summer-house that I added the last of the complete
set of Austrian stamps to my collection. A friend of
my father gave it to me, and I took it down to the
summer-house to put it into my album.”</p>

<p>The three of them wended their way to the summer-house.
William, wearing his Red Indian costume,
followed through the bushes. He found the expression
on Robert’s face highly diverting.</p>

<p>They stood in the summer-house, Uncle Frederick
in the middle, Robert and Flavia on either side, William
discreetly peeping through a crack in the side.</p>

<p>“Well, where’s this view from the summer-house?”
said Uncle Frederick.</p>

<p>“There,” said Robert savagely. Uncle Frederick
looked through the little window.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to me,” he said, “much different
from the view you get from the house.”</p>

<p>Robert ground his teeth.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything at all specially attractive
about the view of the rose garden from this particular
spot,” went on Uncle Frederick. “However—we each
have our own standard of beauty, and what appeals
to one does not appeal to all. I know quite a lot of
people, for instance, who judge stamps entirely by
their artistic appearance, quite irrespective of their
value. Did I ever tell you of the lady who——?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Robert viciously. Uncle
Frederick looked at him coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“I don’t think I did,” he said. “You must be
thinking of some other story I told you. This lady
was forming a stamp collection and I told her that she
could choose any stamp she liked on a certain page of
my album (not one containing my most valuable
stamps, of course) to form the nucleus of her collection,
and she chose one of no value at all just because she
liked the picture on it.”</p>

<p>Robert leaned over to Flavia again.</p>

<p>“Would you care to come and see the greenhouse,”
he said, “and look at the—er—carnations?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Flavia pleasantly, rising.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back with you in a minute, Uncle,” said
Robert hastily, seeing that Uncle Frederick was
rising, too.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll come and look at the carnations,” said
Uncle Frederick. “I’m very much interested in
carnations. And very unusual, too, for them to be
out this time of the year.”</p>

<p>The three of them went on to the greenhouse and
stood there, Uncle Frederick in the middle, Robert
and Flavia on either side. Uncle Frederick looked
about him.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “where are the carnations? I
don’t see any carnations.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean carnations,” said Robert desperately,
“I meant,” he swept his arm wildly round the greenhouse,
“I meant these.”</p>

<p>“These,” Uncle Frederick adjusted his spectacles
and began to look around. “I see ... Begonias.
Very nice, very nice. I’m glad you thought of showing
us these, Robert. I’m very fond of begonias, aren’t
you, Flavia?”</p>

<p>Robert, standing behind his uncle, bared his lips in
a silent and impotent snarl of fury. It was at that
moment that he espied William’s feather-encircled
head gazing through one of the glass panes with a smile
of quiet enjoyment. He turned the snarl of fury on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
to William. William promptly disappeared. Uncle
Frederick turned abruptly and caught the tail-end
of the snarl of fury. He looked startled and concerned.</p>

<p>“Are you in pain, my poor boy?” he said.</p>

<p>“No,” said Robert, “I mean yes. I mean, not
much.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ve been over-doing it,” he said.
“Flavia, we’ve tired out our young friend, I’m afraid.
The walk was too much for him. I suspect that he
indulges in too much physical exercise and too little
mental recreation. You should collect stamps, my
boy. There’s nothing like it. Have I ever told you
how I came to collect stamps?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Robert. “I mean yes. Yes, you
have.”</p>

<p>At that minute the first lunch gong sounded.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about the origin of my stamp collection
afterwards. Let us now follow yon welcome sound.”</p>

<p>Groaning inwardly, Robert followed it. He stalked
angrily into the dining-room and flung himself into
the nearest chair. It was unfortunate that William
had been into the room a minute before and had carelessly
flung down his Red Indian head-dress upon that
very chair, and that at the end of the head-dress was
the unguarded pin that had secured it around William’s
head. Robert leapt into the air with a high-pitched
cry of agony, which swiftly changed to a growl of
fury when he saw the cause of his involuntary ascent.
The sight of the head-dress reminded him, too, of the
unholy grin on William’s face as it peered in at the
greenhouse, rejoicing in his discomfiture. With a
gesture of rage he flung the whole thing into the fire.
That to a small extent—a very small extent—relieved
his feelings, so that when William entered a few
minutes later, still wearing his frilled khaki trousers
and looked around with a stern “Where’s my feather
thing?” Robert could answer with great dignity and
nonchalance: “In the fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Who put it there?” said William.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Robert.</p>

<p>William’s face grew stern and lowering, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t leave it about all over the place,”
said Robert.</p>

<p>“Did you sit on the pin?” said William with sudden
hope.</p>

<p>But Robert refused to allow him even that gleam of
comfort.</p>

<p>“Course I didn’t,” he said.</p>

<p>“I bet you did,” said William, “an’ let me tell
<i>you</i>. There’s not many people’d dare to throw away a
Red Indian head thing. At least,” he ended darkly,
“not without knowin’ somethin’d happen to them.”</p>

<p>With this sinister threat he withdrew, to put his
head round the door a few minutes later, having
thought of something else to say.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be so mad at <i>me</i>,” he said. “<i>I’ve</i>
not been goin’ round with you all mornin’ talkin’
about my stamp collection. Why don’ you throw one
of <i>his</i> hats in the fire?”</p>

<p>And withdrew before Robert could get hold of
anything to throw at him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They met in the barn. William, Ginger, Douglas
and Joan. They all wore their Red Indian dresses.
Joan—the only female Outlaw—had a squaw-dress
which she had made herself and which made up in
ornamentation what it lacked in cut and unobtrusiveness
of stitching. Its ornamentation was little short
of reckless. She had sewn the entire contents of
twelve penny boxes of beads on to it. All of them—Joan
openly, the Outlaws secretly—were intensely
proud of it. All except William wore feathered head-dresses.
Briefly William told the story of its disappearance.</p>

<p>“He oughter know it’s a <i>serious</i> thing,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
“throwin’ Red Indian chief’s feathers into the fire.
It’s a <i>ninsult</i>. He’s lucky I’m not a <i>real</i> Red Indian
or he’d be scalped. That’s what he deserves. He
deserves to be scalped—throwin’ Red Indian chief’s
head things into the fire.”</p>

<p>They set out for the wood where they had agreed
to “scout” each other, but William’s gloomy sense
of outraged honour threw a shadow over all of them.
In vain for Ginger, Douglas, Henry and Joan to
comment brightly on the fine day or the prospect of
a good scouting expedition. In vain for each of
them to offer to lend him his own head-dress. In
reply William muttered, “He’s jolly lucky not to be
scalped, that’s what he is. I bet if any <i>real</i> Red
Indian knew he’d done it, he’d come over an’ scalp
him.”</p>

<p>They began to walk over the field that led to the
wood where their scouting expedition was to take
place. Suddenly Joan stopped. “Look!” she said.
“A fairy ring!” William snorted scornfully and
strode on. “Oh, but it is,” said Joan, “do come and
look at it.”</p>

<p>They stopped to look at a little circle of toadstools
in the green grass.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” said William, determined not
to be impressed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“It’s a fairy ring,” said Joan, “if you stand in the
middle and wish, your wish comes true.”</p>

<p>William emitted again his famous snort of contempt
and derision.</p>

<p>“It does,” persisted Joan. “Honestly. The last
time I came across one I stood in the middle and
wished there’d be trifle for dinner and there was.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws were despite themselves impressed by
this. William, however, merely said:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’ve had enough of your fairy stuff.
Do you remember the ole donkey what——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“But, William,” said Joan. “It couldn’t do any
harm just to wish something.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said William.</p>

<p>He stepped into the fairy ring.</p>

<p>“I wish a real Indian Chief’d come along an’ scalp
Robert for burnin’ my head thing,” he said.</p>

<p>Then they all proceeded except Ginger, who stepped
hastily into the ring and silently wished that there
might be roast turkey, strawberries and cream and
trifle and ice cream for supper. He was aware that
this was very unlikely, but he was optimistic and
thought it worth trying.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>William had almost forgotten his grievance when he
returned home for tea. His mother was out, but Uncle
Frederick was having tea with Robert and Flavia.</p>

<p>“Apart from its historical and geographical interest
it’s such a wonderful investment,” Uncle Frederick
was saying. “I know of a stamp which sold for four
pounds in 1898 and which sells for over fifteen pounds
to-day.”</p>

<p>Robert cleared his throat. He had long ago
relinquished subtle methods in trying to oust Uncle
Frederick’s stamps from the conversation and
introduce his own topics.</p>

<p>“I made a wireless set last month,” he said.</p>

<p>“Great Britain 1840,” said Uncle Frederick.</p>

<p>“Seven valves,” said Robert.</p>

<p>“Black V. R.,” said Uncle Frederick.</p>

<p>“I can get Germany,” said Robert.</p>

<p>Flavia merely sat by as usual serenely conscious of
her beauty.</p>

<p>Uncle Frederick despite himself yielded to Robert’s
determined egotism.</p>

<p>“A what?” he said, “a wireless set?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Robert, glancing at Flavia to make
sure that she was listening. “I made it myself.
Seven valves. I can get anywhere with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“Strange as it may seem,” said Uncle Frederick,
“I have never listened to one of those instruments—‘listened
in’ is, I believe, the correct expression.
As it happens I do not possess one myself, nor do any
of my friends. Nor have I ever wished to purchase
one. As an entertainment I do not consider that it
even approaches stamp collecting. But still—I see
that it might be interesting. The news, for instance—the
weather forecast—that is given every night, I
believe.”</p>

<p>William, considering that he had been left out of the
conversation long enough and seeing an opportunity of
entering into it, swallowed half a bun unmasticated
and burst out:</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s giv’n every night, but it’s nothin’ to go
by. The weather forecast, I mean. If it says it’s
goin’ to rain it gen’rally doesn’t, and if it says it isn’t,
it gen’rally does.” He caught Robert’s eye fixed on
him sternly, with an expression that could only mean
that he was going to eject him mercilessly from the
conversation at the first opportunity, and returning
the gaze defiantly continued in a loud voice: “The
weather forecast comes first an’ then the S.O.S’s and
then——”</p>

<p>“S.O.S.?” said Uncle Frederick, “and what is
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s telling people away from home when
they’re wanted at home,” said William vaguely.
“Tellin’ ’em you know when somethin’s gone wrong
an’ they’ve gotter go home at once.”</p>

<p>Uncle Frederick seemed much impressed.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, “an excellent idea. A means of
getting into touch at once with anyone who is absent.
An excellent idea. I see. Then——”</p>

<p>“Seven valves,” said Robert at last, forcing his
way back into the conversation, talking to Uncle
Frederick and gazing at the serene and beautiful
Flavia, “seven valves—a much larger number than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
most sets are made with. It took me a very long
time to make it. I——”</p>

<p>William, realising that all further attempts on his
part at getting back into the conversation would be
firmly thwarted by Robert, put one bun into his
mouth, slipped another into his pocket and quietly
departed.</p>

<p>The indignity of having had his Indian head-dress
destroyed still rankled in William’s breast, but it was
growing dimmer with the passage of time. He made
his way to a neighbouring farm and there made a
collection of hens’ feathers to form a new and yet
more splendid head-band. He then took them to a
wood near by to count and he was engaged thus when
to his amazement and dismay he beheld a Red Indian
Chief in full panoply approaching him through the
wood. He rubbed his eyes to make sure that it was
true and not a vision. It was true. A tall man with
a red, hawk-nosed face, an enormous head-dress of
feathers, wearing magnificent Red Indian panoply,
was stalking past him through the wood in the direction
of the road that led to William’s house. It was
amazing. But there it was. It was true. And
suddenly he remembered his wish in the fairy ring—that
a real Red Indian Chief should come and scalp
Robert. His heart sank down to his shoes. Crumbs!
This was more than he’d bargained for! <i>Crumbs!</i>
He’d no idea—— He gazed at the vision with awe
and astonishment and growing horror. He could
not, of course, know that the vision was an
acquaintance of Robert’s who had arranged to call
for Robert on his way to a small fancy dress party
to which they were both going. Robert had as a
matter of fact carefully hidden from William his intention
of going to the fancy dress party, on the general
principle that the less William knew of his movements
the better. William roused himself from his
paralysis and rose trembling to intercept the stranger.</p>

<p>“Where you goin’?” he demanded tremulously.</p>

<p>“To The Hollies,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>William’s heart sank yet deeper. The Hollies was
the name of William’s house.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Who—who you goin’ there for?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“For Robert Brown,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>It was true. William moistened his lips.</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do to Robert?” he said faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>The stranger looked down. He liked making fun of
small boys.</p>

<p>“Scalp him,” he answered with a dramatic snarl,
and began again to stride through the wood. William
hurried along trying to keep pace with him.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said breathlessly. “I didn’t mean
it. Honest, I didn’t. I didn’t know there was anythin’
in it. Honest, I didn’t. I don’ want you to do
it, really. I mean, I c’n make a new one an’ I don’
really mind now. P’raps he sat on the pin an’ then
threw it into the fire without thinkin’ what he was
doin’. Look here, if you go back where you came
from——”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?” demanded the
stranger, striding onwards.</p>

<p>“You—you can’t go to Robert,” said William
desperately. “’S’no use goin’ for him. You won’t
find him. He’s not at home.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” demanded the stranger.</p>

<p>William was silent for a moment, searching in his
mind for some place whither a Red Indian, lusting for
vengeance, could not follow.</p>

<p>At last:</p>

<p>“He’s gone up in an aeroplane,” he said, “an’ none
of us know when he’s comin’ down, so it’s no use you
waitin’ for him.”</p>

<p>At this moment Robert, dressed in a Harlequin
costume, issued from a side gate and hailed his friend.</p>

<p>“Hallo,” he said, “you’re in jolly good time, and,
by Jove, you do look fine!”</p>

<p>William, with a snort of disgust, turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Robert’s friend watched his retreating figure.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” he said.</p>

<p>“My brother,” said Robert.</p>

<p>“Is he potty?” said the friend. “He just said
you’d gone up in an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s as potty as they make ’em,” said
Robert carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Robert had been uncertain whether to go to the
fancy dress party or not. Had there been any chance
of spending the evening alone with Flavia, he would,
of course, not have gone, but Uncle Frederick had
announced his intention of reading aloud to Flavia
and him a little pamphlet he had just bought called
“The Romance of Stamp Collecting.” So in disgust
Robert went with his friend to the fancy dress party.
And the next morning he carelessly threw to William
the most magnificent feathered head-dress William
had ever seen.</p>

<p>“That chap who went with me last night gave me
that,” he said; “he’d got two and didn’t want this
one, so he gave it to me. You can have it.”</p>

<p>It is probable that very mixed motives had prompted
Robert’s gift. It is possible that he felt some compunction
of heart at his impulsive destruction of
William’s treasured head-dress. It is more than
possible that he felt apprehensive as to the results.
He knew that people did not as a rule insult William
with impunity. He had been as a matter of fact
nervously awaiting some counter-move on William’s
part ever since he committed the outrage.</p>

<p>It was such a very magnificent head-dress that
William felt an overpowering sensation of gratitude.
It tied his hands. It poisoned his peace of mind.
It made him feel obliged to be polite and subservient
to Robert, and William hated feeling obliged to be
polite and subservient to anyone. He liked to feel
free, and untrammelled to carry on that perpetual
guerilla warfare with Robert that lent life some of
its necessary zest. The only way of escaping this
nauseating sense of obligation was, of course, to bestow
upon Robert some magnificent benefit in return—some
benefit, in short, commensurate with the feathered
head-dress.</p>

<p>William sat in his bedroom gazing at the stupendous
gift, torn between ecstasy at its possession, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
hopeless realisation of the impossibility of conferring
upon Robert any comparable benefit. He rose, put
on his Red Indian suit, tied on the wonderful feather
head-band, and, drunk with pride and rapture, swaggered
to and fro before his looking-glass. Then he
sat down on the floor, and chin in hand, brows drawn
into a fierce frown, he thought and thought and
thought and thought. What could he give to Robert,
what could he do for Robert, to win back his independence
of spirit? No light broke in upon the
problem. He rose and went to the window. There
below him in the garden walked Uncle Frederick
with Robert and Flavia upon either side. Uncle
Frederick looked very happy. He was gesticulating
forcibly as he talked. He was talking about his set of
1923 Esthonia Triangular, over printed and surcharged.
Scarce.</p>

<p>Robert walked dejectedly, casting alternate glances
of fury at Uncle Frederick and languishment at Flavia.
Flavia walked with eyes demurely downcast, occasionally
returning Robert’s gaze. Emboldened by this,
Robert suggested that Uncle Frederick should sit
down and rest upon the garden seat and that he and
Flavia should have a little game of tennis on the
hard court. Uncle Frederick said that he’d love a
little game of tennis and that he’d take them both
on and beat them both hollow. He went in to change
his shoes and dejectedly they followed.</p>

<p>William returned to his seat on the floor and again
contorted his freckled countenance into an expression
indicative of deep thought. Then suddenly a light
shone through it. He rose to his feet and, still wearing
his head-dress, performed a dance of victory, snatching
up a tooth-brush to wave in lieu of a spear.</p>

<p>He knew now what he was going to do for Robert.</p>

<p>It was the next evening. Flavia had gone out to
tea with Mrs. Brown. Robert had very, very moodily
gone off for a walk by himself. Uncle Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
was sitting alone in the dining-room reading the
paper.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the entry of William—William
wearing that guileless expression of imbecility
that to those who knew him well betokened danger.
Uncle Frederick, however, was not among those who
knew William well. William sat and looked into the
fire in silence, a far-away, wistful expression upon his
face. This attracted Uncle Frederick’s attention.</p>

<p>“A penny for your thoughts, my little man.”</p>

<p>William with an effort concealed his indignation
at being thus addressed, and still guilelessly, wistfully
replied:</p>

<p>“I was thinking about the wireless Robert’s made.
It’s such a beautiful one.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Uncle Frederick pleasantly, “I must
certainly hear that wireless.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to go and hear it now,” said
William. “I think that Robert would be so pleased
when he came in to know that you’d been listening
to his wireless.” Again Uncle Frederick was vaguely
touched by this.</p>

<p>“Then certainly we must go and listen to it, my
little man,” he said.</p>

<p>“Will you come now?” said his little man, rising
and holding out a grubby hand confidingly.</p>

<p>Uncle Frederick was very, very comfortable, but he
could not resist the invitation of that outstretched
grubby hand. He rose reluctantly, took it somewhat
gingerly and saying heartily:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we must certainly hear this wireless.
Just for a few minutes, of course. A few minutes, I
think, will be enough.”</p>

<p>He threw a longing glance at the fire and his newspaper,
then yielded to the firm pressure of William’s
hand and allowed himself to be drawn from the
room.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said William. “You just turn this,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
and William, secure in the knowledge that no programme
was going on at the moment, made the
reaction handle turn a complete circuit till it was
where it had been to start with.</p>

<p>“It will begin in a few minutes now,” he said.
“Only I’ve just got to go an’ do some lessons. Jus’
wait a minute an’ it will come. I’m sorry I can’t
wait.”</p>

<p>Uncle Frederick, sitting in front of Robert’s wireless
which was just in front of the drawn window curtains,
waited just a minute or two—waited in fact just long
enough for William to run out of the side door round
the house, and to put in his head at the open window
of the morning-room behind the curtain. Then Uncle
Frederick’s patience was rewarded. A deep bass
voice (which those who knew William better might
have recognised as one of his “disguised” voices)
began to speak. It said:</p>

<p>“London callin’ the British Isles. There is a ridge
of high pressure movin’ Eastwards over England,
together with a secondary anticyclone deepenin’ over
Scandinavia.</p>

<p>“There is one S.O.S. Will Mr. Frederick Brown
kindly go home at once as his Stamp Collection has
been stolen. It——”</p>

<p>But Uncle Frederick could not wait for more. He
leapt from his seat, flew up to his bedroom, hastily
packed a bag and, hurling an incoherent message at
William, rushed forth into the night.</p>

<p>William, looking quite expressionless, explained
matters as best he could to his bewildered family on
their return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“HERE’S ROBERT’S WIRELESS SET, UNCLE FREDERICK,”
SAID WILLIAM. “YOU JUST TURN THIS. THERE!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Well, he just said he’d had bad news and had to
go home. Had he had a telegram? I dunno. P’raps
he had. No, I didn’t see one. No, he didn’t say
what sort of bad news. Something about something
stolen. Had he been rung up? I dunno.
P’raps he had. I wasn’t at home in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Well, he’d just gone into the morning-room to listen
to Robert’s wireless. I wasn’t there with him. I
just turned it on for him to listen and then I went out.
I <i>keep tellin’</i> you I wasn’t there with him. He came
rushin’ out an’ said he’d gotter go home. No, why
should I know anythin’ about it? I <i>keep tellin’</i> you.
He went into the mornin’ room to listen to Robert’s
wireless and he came rushin’ out and went home.
Well, how should I know anythin’ about it, more’n
anyone else?”</p>

<p>Robert’s expression throughout the recital had been
gradually brightening till it was now a veritable glow.
He looked at Flavia.</p>

<p>“Would you care to come out for a little stroll in
the garden, Flavia?” he said. “It’s quite a nice
evening.”</p>

<p>And Flavia dimpling demurely murmured: “Yes,
I’d love it.”</p>

<p>The next morning there arrived a long letter from
Uncle Frederick. He told them about the message
he’d received by wireless and how he’d been assured
by all his friends that no such message had been sent
by wireless, and that no such message could have been
sent by wireless. They all said that he must have
dropped asleep and dreamed it, and that was the
explanation that he had finally adopted. He must
have dropped into a doze while he sat waiting for the
wireless to begin and dreamed it. Anyway, he thought
that he’d stay at home now and not return for the
remainder of his visit as the incident had made him
nervous. Dreams were, he was sure, often sent for a
warning and he thought he’d like to be on the spot
for the next few months in case there were any thieves
about who had their eye on his stamp collection.
He was afraid that his two young friends would miss
him very much, but he was sure they would forgive
him and understand.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>It was evening. All was well. An atmosphere of
peace hung over the house. Robert and Flavia had
packed a picnic basket and gone off for the day.</p>

<p>William, wearing his new and magnificent headgear,
was demonstrating his freshly regained independence of
spirit by erecting a cunning arrangement above
Robert’s bedroom door, whereby when Robert opened
it a pillow would drop down and, he hoped, completely
envelop Robert’s head.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER VIII</small><br>

WILLIAM’S LUCKY DAY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WILLIAM and the other Outlaws sat in the old
barn discussing the latest tragedy that had
befallen them. Tragedies, of course, fell thick and fast
upon the Outlaws’ path through life. They waged
ceaseless warfare upon the grown-up world around
them and, as was natural, they frequently came off
second best. But this was a special tragedy. Not
only was it a grown-up victory, but it was a victory
that bade fair to make the Outlaws’ daily lives a
perpetual martyrdom at the hands of their contemporaries.</p>

<p>Usually, the compensating element of a grown-up
victory was the fact that it concentrated upon them
the sympathy of their associates—a sympathy that not
infrequently found tangible form in the shape of bullseyes
or conkers. But this grown-up victory was a
victory that promised to make the lives of the early
Christian martyrs beds of roses in comparison with
those of the Outlaws.</p>

<p>The way it happened was this.</p>

<p>The headmaster of William’s school had a cousin
who was a Great Man, and once a year the cousin who
was a Great Man came down to the school to address
the boys of William’s school. He possessed, presumably,
gifts of a high and noble order, otherwise he would
not have been a Great Man, but whatever those gifts
may have been they did not include that of holding
the interest of small boys. Only the front two rows
could ever hear anything he said and not even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
front two rows (carefully chosen by the headmaster
for their—misleadingly—intelligent expressions) could
understand it.</p>

<p>It might be gathered from this that the annual
visit of the Great Man was looked forward to without
enthusiasm, but this was not the case, for always at
the end of the lecture he turned to the headmaster and
asked that the boys might be given a half-holiday the
next day, and the headmaster, after simulating first of
all intense surprise and then doubt and hesitation,
while the rows of small boys watched him in breathless
suspense, their eyes nearly dropping out of their
heads, finally said that they might. Then someone
called for three cheers for the Great Man, and the
roof quivered. The Great Man was always much
gratified by his reception. He always said afterwards
that it was delightful to see young boys taking a deep
and intelligent interest in such subjects as Astronomy
and Egyptology and Geology, and that the cheers
with which they greeted the close of the lecture left
him with no doubt at all of their appreciation of it.
The school in general went very carefully the day
before the lecture because it was known that the
headmaster disliked granting the half-holiday and
with the meanness of his kind would welcome with
hidden joy and triumph any excuse for cancelling
it. The Great Man’s visit was a nervous strain on
the headmaster, and his temper was never at its best
just then. To begin with, it was an exhausting and
nerve-racking task to discover sufficient boys with
intelligent expressions to fill the front rows. Then
the other boys had to be graded in diminishing degrees
of cleanliness and presentability to the back of the
hall which the Great Man, being very short-sighted,
could not see, and where the least presentable specimens
were massed. The Outlaws were always relegated to
the very back row. They found no insult in this, but
were, on the contrary, grateful for it. By a slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
adjustment of their positions they could hide themselves
comfortably from the view of Authority, and
give their whole attention to such pursuits as conker
battles, the swopping of cigarette-cards, or the
“racing” of insects conveyed thither in match-boxes
for the purpose. But this year a terrible thing had
happened.</p>

<p>The Great Man arrived at the village as usual. As
usual he stayed with the headmaster. As usual the
Outlaws hid behind the hedge to watch him with
interest and curiosity as he passed to and from the
headmaster’s house, going to the village or returning
from it. It was unfortunate that the Great Man
happened to be wearing a bowler hat that was undoubtedly
too small for him. He may have bought it
in a hurry and not realised till he had worn it once
or twice how much too small it was, and then with
dogged British courage and determination decided
to wear it out. He may have been honestly labouring
under the delusion that it suited and fitted him. The
fact remains that when he emerged from the headmaster’s
gate into the lane the waiting and watching
Outlaws drew deep breaths and ejaculated simultaneously:</p>

<p>“Crumbs! Look at his hat!”</p>

<p>“Don’t look like a hat at all,” commented Douglas.</p>

<p>“Looks like as if he was carryin’ an apple on his
head,” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“William Tell,” said Henry with the modest air
of one who, without undue ostentation, has no wish
to hide his culture and general information under a
bushel. “You know, William Tell. What his
father shot an apple off his head without touchin’
him.”</p>

<p>“An’ I bet I could shoot his hat off his head without
touchin’ him if I’d got my catapult here,” said William,
in order to divert the limelight from Henry’s intellect
to his own physical prowess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Bet you couldn’t,” challenged Ginger.</p>

<p>“Bet I could,” said William.</p>

<p>“Bet you couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Bet I could.”</p>

<p>It was the sort of discussion that can go on for ever.
However, when it had gone only about ten minutes,
William said with an air of finality:</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t got my catapult, anyway, or else
I’d jolly well <i>show</i> you.”</p>

<p>Ginger unexpectedly produced a catapult.</p>

<p>“Here’s mine,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t got anything to shoot.”</p>

<p>Douglas searched in his pocket and produced from
beneath the inevitable string, hairy boiled sweets,
pen-knife and piece of putty, two or three shrivelled
peas.</p>

<p>William was taken aback till he realised that the
Great Man had passed out of sight. Then he said,
with something of relief: “Well, I can’t, can I?
Considerin’ he’s gone!” and added with withering
sarcasm, “if you’ll kin’ly tell me how to shoot the hat
off a person’s head what isn’t here I’ll be very glad
to——”</p>

<p>But at that moment the figure of the Great Man
was seen returning down the lane. He had only
been to the post. The spirit of adventure—that
Will-o’-the-wisp that had so often led the Outlaws
astray but that they never could resist—entered into
them.</p>

<p>“Go on, William,” urged Ginger. “Have a shot
at his hat an’ see if you c’n knock it off. It won’t
matter. It’ll only go ‘ping’ against his hat and
we’ll be across the next field before he knows what’s
happened. He’ll never know it was us. Go on,
William. Have a shot at his hat.”</p>

<p>The figure was abreast of them now on the other
side of the hedge.</p>

<p>William, his eyes gleaming with excitement, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
face set and stern with determination, raised the
catapult and had a shot at the Great Man’s hat.</p>

<p>He had been unduly optimistic. He did not shoot
the little hat off the Great Man’s head as he had
boasted he could. Instead he caught the Great Man
himself just above his ear. It was, on the whole,
not a very bad shot, but William did not stop to
point that out to his friends. A dried pea emitted
from a catapult can hurt more than those who have
never received it have any conception of.</p>

<p>For a minute the Great Man was literally paralysed
by the shock. Then he uttered a roar of pain, fury
and outraged dignity and started forward, lusting
for the blood of his assailant. The dastardly attack
had seemed to come from the direction of the hedge.
He flung himself in that direction. He could see three
boys fleeing over the field and then—clutching desperately
at the hedge above him—a fourth boy rolled
back into the ditch. The Great Man pounced upon
him. It was William, who had caught his foot while
scrambling through the hedge, and lost his balance.
He bore in his hand the evidence of his guilt in the
shape of Ginger’s catapult. It was useless for him
to deny that he was the perpetrator of the outrage—useless
even to plead the analogy of William Tell
and the apple.</p>

<p>The Great Man had mastered the first violence of
his fury. With a great effort he choked back several
expressions which, though forcible, were unsuited for
the ears of the young, and fixing William with a stern
eye said severely: “I see by your cap that you attend
the school at which I am to lecture to-morrow. After
this outrage I shall not, of course, ask for the usual
half-holiday, and I shall request your headmaster
to inform your schoolfellows of the reason why no
half-holiday is accorded this year.”</p>

<p>Then—stern, dignified, an impressive figure were
it not for the smallness of his hat, which the shock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
of William’s attack had further knocked slightly
crooked—the Great Man passed on down the lane.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>William, with pale, set face, returned to his waiting
friends.</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” he said succinctly, “that’s done it. That’s
jolly well <i>done</i> it.” Then, savagely, to Ginger: “It’s
all your fault, taking your silly ole catapult about
with you wherever you go an’ gettin’ people to shoot
at other people all over the place. <i>Now</i> look what
you’ve done.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I like that!” said Ginger with spirit. “I
like that. What about <i>you</i> falling about in ditches?
If <i>you’d</i> not gone fallin’ about in ditches he’d never’ve
known about it. Huh! A nice Red Indian <i>you’d</i>
make fallin’ about in ditches. An’, anyway, you were
wrong an’ I was right. You <i>couldn’t</i> shoot his hat
off without touchin’ his face. I <i>said</i> you couldn’t.”</p>

<p>He ended on a high-pitched note of jeering triumph
which the proud spirit of William found intolerable.
They hurled themselves upon each other in deadly
combat, which was, however, terminated by Henry
who enquired with innocent curiosity:</p>

<p>“What did he say, anyway?”</p>

<p>This suddenly reminded William of what the Great
Man had said, and his fighting spirit died abruptly.</p>

<p>He sat down on the ground with Ginger on top of
him and told them forlornly what the Great Man had
said.</p>

<p>On hearing it Ginger’s fighting spirit, too, died, and
he got off William and sat in the road beside him.</p>

<p>“<i>Crumbs!</i>” he said in an awestruck voice of
horror.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the Outlaws that all their
mutual recrimination promptly ceased at this news.</p>

<p>This was no mere misfortune. This was tragedy,
and a tragedy in which they must all stand together.
In the persecution from all ranks of their schoolfellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
that would inevitably follow, they must identify
themselves with William, their leader; they must share
with him the ostracism, and worse than ostracism,
that the Great Man’s sentence would bring upon
them.</p>

<p>“<i>Crumbs!</i>” breathed Henry, voicing their feelings,
“won’t they just be <i>mad</i>!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ’em I did it,” said William in a faint
voice.</p>

<p>“You didn’t do it,” said Ginger aggressively.
“Whose catapult was it, anyway? An’ who dared
you to?”</p>

<p>“An’ whose pea was it?” put in Douglas with equal
indignation.</p>

<p>“I did it, anyway,” said William. “It was my
fault. I’ll tell ’em so.”</p>

<p>“It was me just as much as you,” said Ginger with
spirit.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“It was.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“It was.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t.”</p>

<p>This argument, like the previous one, might have
developed into a healthy physical contest had not
Henry said slowly:</p>

<p>“He can’t’ve told <i>him</i> yet ’cause <i>he’s</i> gone up to
London to choose prizes an’ I heard someone say he
wun’t be back till the last train to-night.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Through four grimy, freckled,
disconsolate faces shone four sudden gleams of hope.</p>

<p>“P’raps if you told him you were sorry an’ ask him
not to——” suggested Douglas.</p>

<p>William leapt to his feet with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said tersely and followed by his
faithful band made his way across the field through
the hedge and down the lane that led to the headmaster’s
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>He performed an imperious and very lengthy tattoo
on the knocker—a tattoo meant to be indicative of
the strength and durability of his repentance.</p>

<p>A pretty housemaid appeared.</p>

<p>She saw one small and very dirty boy on the doorstep
and three other small and very dirty boys hanging over
the gate. She eyed them with disfavour. She disliked
small and dirty boys.</p>

<p>“We’re not deaf,” she said haughtily.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you?” said William with polite interest.
“I’m not either. But I’ve gotter naunt what’s so
deaf that——”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she snapped.</p>

<p>William, pulled up in this pleasant chat with the
pretty housemaid, remembered what he wanted and
said gloomily: “I want to speak to the man what’s
staying with the headmaster.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“William Brown.”</p>

<p>“Well, stay there, and I’ll ask him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said William preparing to enter.</p>

<p>She pushed him back.</p>

<p>“I’m not having them boots in my hall,” she said
with passionate indignation, and went in, closing
the door upon him.</p>

<p>William looked down at his boots with a puzzled
frown and then called out anxiously to his friends
over the gate:</p>

<p>“There’s nothing wrong with my boots, is
there?”</p>

<p>They looked at William’s boots, large, familiar,
mud-encrusted.</p>

<p>“No,” they said, “they’re quite all right.”</p>

<p>“What’s she talkin’ about, then?” said William.</p>

<p>“P’raps she means they’re <i>muddy</i>,” suggested
Douglas tentatively.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what boots are <i>for</i>, i’n’t it?” said
William sternly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

“TELL HIM HE CAN SHOOT A CATAPULT AT ME.
I DON’T MIND”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Just then the housemaid returned and opened the
door.</p>

<p>“He says if you’re the boy who’s just shot a catapult
at him, certainly not.”</p>

<p>It was quite obvious from William’s expression that
he <i>was</i> the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, what I wanted to say was that——”</p>

<p>Slowly but very firmly she was closing the door
upon him. William planted one of his boots in the
track of the closing door.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he said desperately, “tell him he
can shoot a catapult at me. I don’t mind. Look
here. Tell him I’ll put an apple on my head an’ he
can——”</p>

<p>Again the housemaid indignantly pushed him
back.</p>

<p>“Look at my <i>step</i>!” she said fiercely as she closed
the door. “<i>You</i> and your <i>boots</i>!”</p>

<p>The door was quite closed now.</p>

<p>William opened the flap of the letter-box with his
hand and said hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Tell him that it was all because of his hat. Say
that——”</p>

<p>But she’d disappeared and it was obvious that she
didn’t intend to return.</p>

<p>He rejoined his friends at the gate.</p>

<p>“’S no good,” he said dejectedly. “She won’t
even listen to me. Jus’ keeps on talkin’ about my
boots. They’re jus’ the same as anyone else’s boots,
as far as I can see. Anyway, what’re we goin’ to do
now?”</p>

<p>“Let’s find out what he’s doin’ to-night,” said
Ginger. “If he’s goin’ anywhere you might meet him
on the way an’ see if he’ll listen to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William, “that’s a jolly good idea,
but—how’re we goin’ to find out what he’s doin’
to-night?”</p>

<p>“It’s after tea-time,” announced Henry rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
pathetically. (Henry hated missing his meals.) “I
votes we go home to tea now and then come back an’
talk it over some more.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised if it’s goin’ to be rather
hard,” said William still dejectedly, “findin’ out what
he’s goin’ to do to-night.”</p>

<p>But it turned out to be quite simple.</p>

<p>While Douglas was having tea he heard his father
say to his mother that he’d heard that the headmaster’s
cousin was going to dine with the Carroways, as the
headmaster had gone to London on business and wasn’t
coming back till the last train.</p>

<p>Douglas joyfully took this news back to the meeting
of the Outlaws.</p>

<p>They gave him a hearty cheer and William began to
look as if the whole thing was now settled.</p>

<p>“<i>That’s</i> all right,” he said. “Now I’ll go ’n’ stay
by the front gate of the Carroway house till he comes
along and then I’ll plead with him.”</p>

<p>They looked at him rather doubtfully. Somehow
they couldn’t visualise William pleading. William
defying, William commanding, were familiar figures,
but they had never yet seen William pleading.</p>

<p>“We’ll come along with you,” said Ginger, “an’
help you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said William cheerfully. “We’ll all
plead. It oughter melt him all right, <i>four</i> people
pleadin’. What time ought we to be there?”</p>

<p>“I ’spect they have dinner at half-past seven,”
said Ginger.</p>

<p>“Let’s be there at a quarter past six so’s to be quite
sure not to miss him.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They reached the Carroways’ at a quarter past six
and took up their posts by the gate. So far, so good.
All would, in fact, have gone splendidly had not a
circus happened to be in the act of unloading itself
in the field next the Carroways’ house. The Outlaws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
caught a glimpse of tents, vans, cages. They heard
the sound of a muffled roar, they distinctly saw an
elephant. It was more than flesh and blood could
stand.</p>

<p>“Well,” said William carelessly, “we’ve got here
too early an’ it’s no good wastin’ time hangin’ about.
Let’s jus’ go’n wait in the field jus’ for five minutes
or so. That can’t do any harm.”</p>

<p>Douglas, who was of a cautious disposition,
demurred, but his protests were half-hearted and
already the others were through the hedge and making
their way to the little crowd that surrounded the
caravans and cages. It was beyond their wildest
dreams. There was a lion. There was a tiger.
There was an elephant. There was a bear. There
were several monkeys. They saw a monkey bite a
piece out of someone’s trousers. William laughed
at this so much that they thought he was going to
be sick. The bear sat on its hind legs and flapped
its arms. The lion roared. The elephant took
someone’s hat off. The whole thing was beyond
description.</p>

<p>The Outlaws wandered about, getting in everyone’s
way, putting their noses through the bars of every
cage, miraculously escaping sudden death at every
turn. It was when William thought that they must
have been there nearly five minutes that they asked
the time and found that it was twenty past seven.
They had been there over an hour.</p>

<p>“<i>Crumbs!</i>” they ejaculated in dismay, and William
said slowly:</p>

<p>“Seems impossible to me. P’raps,” with sudden
hope, “their clocks are wrong.”</p>

<p>But their clocks weren’t wrong. They asked four
or five other men and were impatiently given the
same reply.</p>

<p>Aghast, they wandered back to the gate where
they had meant to accost the Great Man, but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
realised that it was no use waiting there now. He
would certainly have arrived by now.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up the drive,” said Ginger, “an’ see if
we c’n see him.”</p>

<p>They crept up the drive. Dusk was falling quickly
and the downstairs rooms were lit up. The drawing-room
curtains were not drawn and the Outlaws were
rewarded by the sight of the Great Man standing on
the hearthrug talking to Mr. and Mrs. Carroway.</p>

<p>They stared at him forlornly from the bushes.</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” moaned William, “of all the <i>rotten</i>
luck!”</p>

<p>Then they discussed the crisis in hoarse whispers.
It would be impossible, of course, to wait till he came
home and by to-morrow he would have seen and
reported matters to the headmaster. Anyone less
determined than the Outlaws would have abandoned
the project and gone home. But not the Outlaws.</p>

<p>“Let’s go round to the other side of the house,”
said William, “an’ have a look at the dining-room.
We might get a chance to whisper to him through the
window or somethin’.”</p>

<p>This was felt to be unduly optimistic, but the
suggestion appealed to the Outlaws’ spirit of adventure
and they followed William round to the side of the
house.</p>

<p>The dining-room window was open but the curtains
were drawn. The curtains, however, did not quite
meet at the top and William said that by climbing
on to the roof of the summer-house he thought he
could see into the room.</p>

<p>Using Ginger and Douglas as a step ladder, he hoisted
himself up on to the roof of the summer-house. It
was now so dark that he could not see the Outlaws
down among the bushes.</p>

<p>“I can’t see into the room yet,” he whispered,
“but,” he added optimistically, “I bet if I stand on
tiptoe——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>At this point the Outlaws became conscious of some
sort of a commotion, of the sound of many excited
voices. Then a man with a lighted lantern began to
make what was obviously a tour of inspection of the
garden.</p>

<p>William crouched down upon his summer-house and
the others crouched down among the bushes.</p>

<p>The man with the lighted lantern passed, muttering
to himself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Great Man stood in the drawing-room talking
to Mr. and Mrs. Carroway and to Mrs. Carroway’s
companion, Miss Seed.</p>

<p>It was, of course, unfortunate that Mrs. Carroway’s
companion was called Miss Seed, and had there been
any other suitable applicant for the post, Mrs. Carroway
would certainly not have chosen Miss Seed. However,
there hadn’t been, so both of them made the
best of the situation and had brought to a fine art
the capacity of looking quite unconscious when their
names were pronounced together.</p>

<p>The Great Man was talking. The Great Man was,
as a matter of fact, never completely happy unless
he was talking, and he had been pleased to find that
he was the only guest because he so often found that
other guests liked to talk as well, and that completely
spoilt the evening for him. He was, however, rather
annoyed when Mrs. Carroway was called out to someone
at the front door in the middle of his very brilliant
summary of the political situation. He cleared his
throat in an annoyed fashion, frowned, and stood in
silence watching the door for her return. He didn’t
consider Mr. Carroway alone worth addressing, and
Miss Seed had gone out to see to the dinner, because
Mrs. Carroway was, as usual, without maids and one
of the reasons why Mrs. Carroway had chosen Miss
Seed as a companion, despite her name, was that she
did not mind seeing to dinners in the intervals of
companioning Mrs. Carroway. After a few minutes
Mrs. Carroway returned.</p>

because there’s only a fence between our back garden

<p>The Great Man cleared his throat and took command
of the situation.</p>

<p>“Send the man round the garden to search,” he
said, “and we will meantime remain perfectly calm and
lock up all the doors and windows. Be brave, Mrs.
Carroway, and trust yourself to my protection. I will
see that all the doors and windows are securely fastened.
Courage! Remember we are English men and, ahem,
English women, and must show no fear. Lock and

<p>The Great Man then made a tour of the house,
closing every door and window firmly. Finally, he
collected Mr. and Mrs. Carroway and Miss Seed into
the drawing-room where he locked the shutters and
moved the grand piano across the door.</p>

<p>“Let courage and fortitude be our motto,” he said.
“Let us now meet danger calmly.”</p>

<p>No one listened to him. Miss Seed was tending
Mrs. Carroway who was in hysterics and was hoping
that she’d soon be sufficiently recovered to allow her
to have them in her turn, and Mr. Carroway was trying
to get under the sofa.</p>

<p>The Great Man, therefore, had no one to address
but his own reflection in the full-length mirror. So
he addressed it spiritedly.</p>

<p>“England expects——” he began. At this moment
there came a loud rat-tat-tat at the knocker. Mrs.
Carroway, who was just coming out of hysterics, went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
into them again, and Mr. Carroway put his head out
of the sofa to say reassuringly: “Don’t be alarmed,
dearest. It can’t be the lion. The lion couldn’t
reach up to the knocker.”</p>

<p>Then someone pushed open the letter-box and the
voice of the man with the lantern called: “He ain’t
in your garden, mister. I’ve been all over your
garden,” and added sarcastically: “You can come
out from hunder the sofa. ’E won’t ’urt you.”</p>

<p>With great dignity, Mr. Carroway came out from
under the sofa.</p>

<p>“What a very impertinent man,” said Mr. Carroway.
“I shall report him to the manager of his
firm.”</p>

<p>The Great Man began to unbarricade the door.</p>

<p>“We may all justly pride ourselves,” he said, “upon
the dauntless courage we have displayed in face of
this crisis.”</p>

<p>“I’m so hungry,” said Miss Seed pathetically.</p>

<p>“Hungry?” said Mrs. Carroway. “I’m <i>past</i> hunger.
I shall never, never, <i>never</i> be able to describe to you
what I’ve suffered during these last few minutes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroway looked rather relieved at the
information.</p>

<p>They went into the dining-room and took their
seats. Miss Seed brought in the dinner, and the
Great Man returned to the opportunities the
Government had missed.</p>

<p>“I still feel faint,” said Mrs. Carroway, unwilling to
share the limelight with the Government or anyone
else. “I still feel most faint. I always do after any
nervous shock.”</p>

<p>Her husband went to the window and drew back
the curtains and opened the window.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know that I’d do that,” said Mrs.
Carroway, gazing fearfully out into the dark garden.
“One can’t be <i>quite</i> sure—I mean——”</p>

<p>At that moment came the sound of a heavy body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
crashing through the undergrowth. With a wild
scream Mrs. Carroway rose and fled from the room.</p>

<p>“Quick,” she panted, “out of the front door and
across to the Vicarage for refuge. The creature is
gathering for a spring. This house is unsafe——”</p>

<p>She was half-way down the front drive by this
time, followed closely by the others. The Great Man,
being far from nimble on his feet, panted along at
the end, gasping “Courage, friends ... let courage be
our motto.”</p>

<p>The house was left empty and silent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The sound of the heavy crashing through the
undergrowth had of course been William leaping
down from the roof of the shed to join his companions
below, losing his balance just as he leapt, and falling
among the laurel bushes.</p>

<p>He sat up, rubbing his head and ejecting laurel
leaves from his mouth. Then: “I say, what’s all the
fuss about?” he whispered. “I thought I heard
someone scream.”</p>

<p>“So’d I,” said the Outlaws mystified.</p>

<p>“What was that man goin’ round with a lantern
for?” whispered William.</p>

<p>“I d’no,” said the Outlaws, still more mystified.</p>

<p>“Well,” said William, abandoning the mystery
for the moment, “let’s go an’ see if we can see what
they’re doin’ now. Someone’s drawn the curtains.”</p>

<p>They crept up through the bushes to the open
dining-room window. To their amazement they saw a
brightly lit room, a table laid for four, steaming dishes
upon it, and chairs drawn up in position—all completely
empty.</p>

<p>“Crumbs!” said William in amazement, “that’s
queer.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws gazed in silence at the astounding
sight till Ginger said weakly:</p>

<p>“Where’ve they all <i>gone</i> to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“P’raps they’re in the other room,” suggested
Douglas.</p>

<p>They crept round to the drawing-room window.
The drawing-room was empty.</p>

<p>“P’raps—p’raps,” said Henry without conviction,
“they’re all in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>They crept round to the kitchen. The kitchen was
empty. They looked at the upstairs windows. They
were all in darkness.</p>

<p>William scratched his head and frowned.</p>

<p>“’S very mysterious,” he commented.</p>

<p>Then they returned to the dining-room. It was
still empty. The steaming dishes were still upon the
table. An odour was wafted out to the waiting
Outlaws—an odour so succulent that it was impossible
to resist it. It was William who first swung himself
over the low window sill of the open window into the
room. The others followed. They stood in silence
and gazed at the steaming dishes on the table, the
four places, the four chairs.</p>

<p>“Seems,” said Ginger dreamily, “seems sort of
like a fairy-tale—like a sort of Arabian Nights story.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said William slowly, “it cert’nly seems sort
of <i>meant</i>.”</p>

<p>“I read a tale once like this,” said Douglas, “and
they sat down at the table and invisible hands waited
on them.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try,” said William suddenly, taking his seat
at the head of the table, “let’s try if invisible hands’ll
wait on us.”</p>

<p>They needed no encouragement. They all took
their seats with alacrity. In fairness to whatever
invisible hands might have waited upon the Outlaws,
it must be admitted that they did not get much
chance. The Outlaws began immediately to wait
upon themselves with visible and very grimy hands.
Each had a suspicion that at any minute the feast
might be interrupted. None of them really had much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
faith in the Arabian Nights idea. Under the cover in
front of William was a roast chicken. The dishes
contained bread sauce, gravy, potatoes and cauliflower.
William dismembered the chicken ruthlessly and with
a fine disregard for anatomy, and they helped themselves
from the various dishes. It was a glorious
meal. There was in the room complete silence,
broken only by the sounds of the Outlaws endeavouring
to put away as much of this gorgeous repast as they
could before the dream should fade into reality, and
some grown-up confront them, demanding explanation.
They did not draw breath till every dish was bare
and then, flushed and panting, they sat back and
William said meditatively: “Wonder what they were
goin’ to have after this?”</p>

<p>Douglas suggested giving the invisible hands a
chance, but the suggestion was not popular and
Henry, catching sight of a hatch in the wall, went
to investigate. The hatch slid up and on the ledge
just inside was waiting a magnificent cream edifice
and a little pile of four plates. Four gasps of ecstasy
went up. Again there was silence, broken only by
the sounds of the Outlaws working hard against time.
At last that dish, too, was empty. There was a barrel
of biscuits and a pile of fruit on the sideboard, but
the capacity even of the Outlaws was exhausted.</p>

<p>“I feel I wouldn’t want to eat another thing for
hundreds and hundreds of years,” said Henry blissfully.</p>

<p>“Seems about time we woke up now,” said Douglas.</p>

<p>But to William, who lived ever in the present,
the feast, though the most gorgeous of its kind he had
ever known, was already a thing of the past, and he
was concentrating his whole attention on the problem
of the present.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s <i>happened</i> to ’em?” he said.
“I wonder where they <i>are</i>.”</p>

<p>“Looks like the thing old Markie was tellin’ us about
in school yesterday,” said Henry, “a place where a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
volcano went off suddenly, an’ killed all the people and
left their houses an’ furniture an’ things an’ you can see
it to-day. It’s called Pomples or somethin’ like that.”</p>

<p>This information as emanating from Authority and
savouring of swank was rightly ignored.</p>

<p>“P’raps they’ve all died suddenly of the plague or
something,” suggested Douglas cheerfully.</p>

<p>But the best suggestion came from Ginger.</p>

<p>“I guess someone’s murdered them an’ hid all their
dead bodies upstairs. I bet if we go upstairs we’ll
find all their dead bodies hid there.”</p>

<p>Much inspirited at this prospect the Outlaws
swarmed upstairs and concluded a thorough search
of the premises. The search was disappointing.</p>

<p>“Not many dead bodies,” said William rather
bitterly.</p>

<p>Ginger, feeling that his prestige had suffered from
his failure to prove his theory, looked about him and
with a yell of glee, said:</p>

<p>“No, but look! There’s a trap-door up there and
I bet we could get out on to the roof from it.”</p>

<p>The Outlaws completely forgot both feast and
dead bodies in the thrill of the trap-door by which
you could get out on to the roof.</p>

<p>“Who’ll try it first?” said William.</p>

<p>“Bags me. I saw it first,” said Ginger.</p>

<p>He climbed on to the balusters, leapt at the trap-door,
caught it by a miracle, and swung himself up.
It was a spectacle guaranteed to give any mother
nervous breakdowns for months.</p>

<p>“Does it go out on to the roof?” called the Outlaws,
breathless with suspense.</p>

<p>Faint but ecstatic came back Ginger’s voice:</p>

<p>“Yes, it does. It’s scrummy. Right on the edge
of the roof. I can see right down into the garden.
I can——”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” hissed William, “someone’s coming.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>Downstairs Mr. and Mrs. Carroway, Miss Seed and
the Great Man entered the hall and hastily shut and
locked the front door.</p>

<p>They had gone to the Vicarage and stayed there
for an hour. To the Vicar and his wife it had seemed
much more than an hour because Mrs. Carroway was
acquiring a fatal facility in hysterics and was apparently
beginning to count every moment wasted that was
not devoted to them.</p>

<p>Finally the Vicar rang up the police, learnt that
the missing lion had been seen going down the road
at the other end of the village, and politely but firmly
insisted on his guests departing homewards. He was
beginning to fear the effect of Mrs. Carroway’s hysterics
upon his wife. No woman likes being put so completely
in the shade as Mrs. Carroway’s hysterics put the
Vicar’s wife, and he had noticed that she was beginning
to watch the various stages of the attacks with an
interest that suggested to him that she was storing them
up for future use.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” wailed Mrs. Carroway, “<i>nothing</i> will
induce me to leave this house again to-night. What
I have suffered during that terrible walk from the
Vicarage, hearing and seeing lions at every step, no
one will ever understand. <i>No</i> one. If I talked all
night I couldn’t make you understand.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you couldn’t, dear,” said her husband
hastily.</p>

<p>“I—er—I suppose the house <i>is</i> safe,” said the
Great Man uneasily. “I—er—I cannot help remembering
that we left the—er—the dining-room window
open and that the—er—the place from which the—er—the
beast escaped was—er—just over the
fence.”</p>

<p>“Miss Seed,” said Mrs. Carroway faintly, “go and
see whether there are any traces of it in the dining-room.
The food, you remember, was left on the table.
If that has been tampered with——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Miss Seed sidled cautiously to the dining-room and
peeped in. Then she gave a wild scream.</p>

<p>“It’s been here,” she panted. “It’s been here.
It’s been here. It’s eaten up everything. It must
be in the house—NOW!”</p>

<p>Miss Seed, of course, was overwrought, or she would
have stopped to take into consideration the fact that
a lion does not eat out of a plate with knives and forks
and spoons and that even if it did one lion would
not have used four of each.</p>

<p>“It must be in the house NOW!” she repeated
desperately.</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence—a silence of paralysed
horror. Through this silence came the sound of a
heavy crash upstairs, followed by a snarl of rage.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell the hall was empty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroway had locked herself into the conservatory.</p>

<p>Miss Seed was under the drawing-room sofa.</p>

<p>Mr. Carroway was on the drawing-room mantelpiece.</p>

<p>The Great Man was in the rug box in the hall.</p>

<p>The heavy crash had been Ginger overbalancing
and falling back through the trap-door upon William
in his over anxiety to find out what was going on.
The snarl of rage was William’s involuntary reaction
to the sudden descent of Ginger’s solid form upon
him.</p>

<p>The Outlaws, aghast at the noise they had made,
froze into a petrified silence.</p>

<p>The four grown-ups, in their hiding-places downstairs,
also froze in a petrified silence.</p>

<p>Complete silence reigned throughout the house.</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly by—one minute, two
minutes, three minutes, five minutes. Of the eight
people in the house no one spoke, no one moved, no
one breathed.</p>

<p>At last William whispered: “They must’ve gone
out again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“I din’t hear the door,” hissed Ginger.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to see,” said William.</p>

<p>He peeped cautiously over the balusters. The hall
was empty. The only sound was the solemn ticking
of the grandfather clock.</p>

<p>“I b’lieve they <i>have</i> gone out again,” whispered
William. “I’m goin’ down. Seems to me they’re
all potty.”</p>

<p>He took off his shoes, crept silently down the
stairs to the empty, silent hall and stood there
irresolute.</p>

<p>Then he thought he heard a movement in a chest
near the clock. He approached it and listened.
Heavy, raucous breathing came from inside. He
raised the lid. As he did so there came from it a
high-pitched scream of terror. The open lid revealed
the Great Man. The high-pitched scream of terror
had come from the Great Man. William stared at him
in blank amazement.</p>

<p>The Great Man, instead of seeing the fanged, tawny
face he had expected when the chest lid began slowly
to open, met the astonished gaze of the boy who had
shot at him with a catapult that morning.</p>

<p>They stared at each other in silence. Then a
thoughtful expression came over the face of the
Great Man.</p>

<p>“Er—was it you who made that noise upstairs?”
he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William. “Ginger fell on me. I bet
you’d’ve made a noise if Ginger’d fell on you.”</p>

<p>The expression of the Great Man became yet more
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“And the—er—the dinner——?” he said, still
reclining in the rug box.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted William, “it—it seemed sort of
<i>meant</i>.”</p>

<p>Slowly, stiffly, the Great Man climbed out of the
rug box. It had been a very tight fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_225">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_225.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">WILLIAM AND THE GREAT MAN STARED BLANKLY AT EACH
OTHER. “ER—WAS IT YOU WHO MADE THAT NOISE
UPSTAIRS?” THE GREAT MAN ASKED.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just then the telephone bell rang, and the Great
Man went to answer it. He was glad of the diversion.
He was remembering more and more clearly the high-pitched
cry of terror he had uttered as the chest
opened. He was wondering what explanation he could
give this boy of that and of his presence in the rug box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>The telephone call was from the police. The lion
had been found. The rumour that it had been seen
at the other end of the village had proved to be incorrect.
On escaping from its cage it had wandered
into the further field and gone to sleep in the shelter
of a hayrick. It had just been discovered, roused and
taken back to its cage.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Within a few minutes Miss Seed was putting Mrs.
Carroway to bed, Mr. Carroway was trying to mend
the more valuable of the ornaments he had displaced
from the mantelpiece in his hurried ascent, and the
Great Man had called William aside. The Great Man
was aware that this was a situation requiring delicate
handling. He had tried to think of some dignified
explanation of his presence in the rug box and of that
unfortunate scream, and not one had occurred to him.
He had decided, therefore, not to attempt any. Instead
he assumed his most genial expression and said:</p>

<p>“I believe, my boy, that you—er—are the boy
who accidentally—er—hit me with some missile this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William simply, “a pea.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt at all,” said the Great Man,
“that it was—er—an accident, and—ahem—I do
not after all intend to mention the matter to your
headmaster.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said William, but without much
enthusiasm. William knew when he held the reins
of a situation in his hand.</p>

<p>The Great Man continued: “No need for you—ahem—for
you to mention to anyone what has occurred
here to-night.”</p>

<p>William said nothing. His face was drained of
expression. His eye was blank.</p>

<p>“I will, of course,” went on the Great Man hastily,
“I will—ahem—of course ask for the usual half-holiday
from your headmaster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>William turned upon the Great Man his expressionless
face and his blank eye and said suavely:</p>

<p>“Why not ask for two, sir?”</p>

<p>The Great Man swallowed and cleared his throat.
Then, with a more or less convincing attempt at
heartiness, he said: “Certainly, my boy. Certainly.
A very good idea. I’ll ask for two. And with regard
to what happened here to-night——”</p>

<p>The Great Man was uncomfortably aware that the
story of what had happened there that night as told
by this boy might take some living down.</p>

<p>But William’s face was still expressionless, his eye
still blank.</p>

<p>“You hidin’ in that box to give me a fright?” he
said carelessly. “Oh, no! Why, I’ve nearly forgot
that already.” His blank, unblinking eye was fixed
upon the Great Man. “I bet that after two half-holidays
I’ll have forgot it altogether.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Great Man brought out the request for two
half-holidays with something of an effort. The headmaster
wasn’t prepared for it and was taken aback.
However, he didn’t want to offend the Great Man,
so after a brief inward struggle he promised the two
half-holidays.</p>

<p>Frenzied cheers rent the air.</p>

<p>At the back of the hall, in the back row, sat William
nonchalantly manufacturing a blotting-paper dart,
wholly unmoved apparently by the glorious news.</p>

<p>“Din’t you hear?” yelled a frenzied neighbour,
“din’t you <i>hear</i>? <i>Two</i> half-holidays.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard all right,” said William carelessly.</p>

<p>And, making careful aim, threw his dart at Ginger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER IX</small><br>

A LITTLE ADVENTURE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WILLIAM and Ginger walked slowly down the
village street. They were discussing with
much animation some burglaries that had lately taken
place in the village.</p>

<p>“Robert says,” said William, “that <i>he</i> b’lieves that
it’s not ordin’ry robbers at all an’ that <i>he</i> b’lieves that
it’s people livin’ in the place, people what <i>seem</i> all
right an’ go about doin’ shoppin’ an’ goin’ to church
an’ going out to tea same as orn’ery people. He’s
been readin’ a book where that happened—someone
what was churchwarden in the daytime an’ went out
stealin’ at night. Robert says that he’s goin’ to try to
find out who it is.”</p>

<p>“I bet I know why he wants to find out who it is,”
said Ginger with a note of bitterness in his voice.</p>

<p>“Why?” challenged William.</p>

<p>“’Cause of that Miss Bellairs,” said Ginger.</p>

<p>Miss Bellairs was Robert’s latest inamorata.
Robert’s love affairs were of such a kaleidoscopic
nature that William had long ago ceased to trouble
to keep up with them but not even William had been
able quite to ignore the affair with Miss Bellairs.
Miss Bellairs was an (in William’s eye) elderly woman
of about twenty who had come to stay in the village
with her aunt. Her aunt had a son who was the
object of Robert’s deadly jealousy. So much William
knew, and he knew it only because it was impossible
to live in the same house as Robert and not know it.
He took no interest in it. He did not know or care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
where the girl’s aunt lived or what she was called
or anything else about the matter whatsoever. He
was annoyed at Ginger’s remark, suspecting a hidden
insult in it.</p>

<p>“What d’you know about <i>that</i>?” he said
aggressively.</p>

<p>“I know ’cause Hector’s potty on her too,” said
Ginger dejectedly.</p>

<p>Hector was Ginger’s elder brother. He was (in
the Outlaw’s eyes) as lacking in sanity and consideration
for his youngers as are all elder brothers.</p>

<p>William’s aggressiveness vanished. He felt drawn
to Ginger by a common bond of misfortune and
shame.</p>

<p>“Can’t make out what makes ’em act like that
about her,” he said with fierce exasperation in his
voice. “I’ve seen her an’ she looks perfectly orn’ery
to me.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” agreed Ginger with heartfelt emphasis,
and added scornfully. “<i>Girls!</i> I’m jolly well not
goin’ to <i>speak</i> to a girl ’cept what you have to all
my life.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed William.</p>

<p>This agreement seemed to form a yet closer bond
between them and, each feeling cheered and invigorated
by the knowledge that the world held at least one
person of intelligence besides himself, they returned
to the subject of the burglaries. They discussed
burglaries in general and the present village burglaries
in particular. They discussed burglary as a career
and finally decided that it was less exciting than
that of piracy though more exciting than that of
engine driver—careers to which they had always
inclined.</p>

<p>They had been walking aimlessly along the road
without noticing particularly where they were going,
and they discovered suddenly that they were passing
Ginger’s aunt’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Let’s see if we can see her parrot,” said Ginger.
“It’ll probably be in the front room.”</p>

<p>They crept cautiously up to the window. Ginger’s
aunt was what is known as “house proud” and
Ginger—leaver of muddy boot marks and sticky
finger marks, breaker of nearly everything he touched—knew
that he was not a welcome visitor to her
house. He was not at all sensitive to shades of
manner, but she had left him in no doubt at all on
that subject.</p>

<p>Therefore he crept furtively up to her front window
in order to enjoy the intriguing spectacle of his aunt’s
parrot hopping up and down upon its perch and
uttering malicious chuckles.</p>

<p>“I bet she’s out,” said Ginger. “She always goes
out shopping in the mornings. Let’s open the window
an’ listen to it.”</p>

<p>They opened the window cautiously and put their
heads inside. The parrot began to jump up and
down on his perch still more excitedly when he saw
them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Polly!” said William encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said the parrot.</p>

<p>This delighted his visitors.</p>

<p>“Go on, Polly,” encouraged Ginger. “Go on!
Say something else.”</p>

<p>“Get out, you old fool,” said the parrot with a
snigger.</p>

<p>“Jolly good, isn’t it?” said Ginger proudly. “And
it’s quite tame. It comes out an’ sits on your finger.
My aunt lets me take it out and hold it. At least,”
he corrected himself, “she used to before that last
vase got broke. How could I know,” he added
bitterly, “that a vase would fall off the hall table on
to the floor an’ get broke simply with me comin’
downstairs?”</p>

<p>William made a vague sound suggestive of sympathy
but he was not really interested in the disastrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
reverberations of Ginger’s footfall. He was interested
in the parrot.</p>

<p>“I bet it doesn’t jus’ sit quietly on <i>your</i> finger,”
he said. “It knows <i>her</i> finger, of course, but I bet if
you took it out it wouldn’t sit quiet on yours.”</p>

<p>“It would,” affirmed Ginger aggressively.</p>

<p>“Easy to say that,” said William, “when you
know that you can’t try.”</p>

<p>“I <i>can</i> try,” said Ginger. “She’s out shoppin’,
anyway. She always is in the morning. I bet you
<i>anythin’</i> it’ll sit quiet on my finger. It won’t take
a <i>second</i>. Let’s jus’ get in an’ see.”</p>

<p>He raised the window and with a cautious glance
around the room entered. William followed. The
parrot gave its most vulgar snigger and said: “Oh,
shut up.” It was certainly an attractive bird....</p>

<p>With another hasty glance round Ginger opened
the catch of the cage and put out his finger ready for
the bird to alight upon.</p>

<p>The bird said: “Get out, you old fool,” and hopped
obligingly on to Ginger’s finger.</p>

<p>“<i>There!</i>” said Ginger proudly standing with his
arm outstretched. “There! What did I <i>tell</i> you?”</p>

<p>For a second he stood like that with an indescribable
swagger in his pose, holding out the bird at arm’s
length. For a second only. At the end of a second
the bird suddenly spread its wings and without any
warning at all flew straight out of the window. The
swagger dropped incontinently from Ginger’s pose.
He gazed at the open window, his freckled face pale,
his mouth open.</p>

<p>“<i>Crumbs!</i>” he gasped.</p>

<p>“<i>Crumbs!</i>” echoed William.</p>

<p>Then both of them dived simultaneously through
the window into the garden.</p>

<p>There they gazed around them. The parrot was
sitting quite calmly on a low bush in the next-door
neighbour’s garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>The two Outlaws crept up to the fence and climbing
over it, approached the parrot. The parrot awaited
their approach, chuckling his most malicious chuckle.
He let them come up quite close to him. He waited
till Ginger had put out a hand to grab him, and then
with a combination of his malicious chuckle and his
vulgar snigger he flew off from under Ginger’s very
hand through the open window into the next-door
house.</p>

<p>“<i>Crumbs!</i>” said Ginger again in a tone of helpless
horror.</p>

<p>William crept cautiously up to the window.</p>

<p>“I can see him,” he whispered, “he’s sittin’ on the
piano.”</p>

<p>“Is there anyone in the room?” whispered Ginger
from behind the laurel bush where he had taken cover.</p>

<p>“No. No one. Just a lot of chairs. I’ll go in an’
fetch him. I’ll jus’ get in at this window an’ fetch
him. I’ll——”</p>

<p>He was cautiously pushing up the window.</p>

<p>“I’ll come too,” volunteered Ginger somewhat
dispiritedly. Mental visions of his aunt when she
discovered that her pet was missing were beginning
to haunt him.</p>

<p>“No. Best let only one go alone,” said William,
“then if anything happens to me you’ll be safe to go
on lookin’ for it.”</p>

<p>William’s spirits were rising at the prospects of an
adventure.</p>

<p>He swung himself over the sill and found himself
in a small drawing-room. It was full of chairs arranged
in rows as if for a meeting and there was a table at
one end.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said the parrot excitedly from the
piano.</p>

<p>William began to stalk his prey in his best Red
Indian fashion. It waited till his hand was nearly on
him then, chuckling, flew to the mantelpiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Polly, Polly,” whispered William in fierce, hoarse
coaxing as he approached the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“Get out, you old fool,” said the parrot who seemed
to be thoroughly enjoying himself. He let William
think that he was really going to get him this time,
then with another chuckle spread his wings and flew
off again. This time he circled round and round the
room and finally disappeared behind a cabinet that
stood across a corner of the room, having a fair-sized
recess between it and the wall.</p>

<p>William was just pursuing it to this retreat when
the door opened and a tall, stern-looking woman
wearing pince-nez and a high collar entered the room.
She looked at William in surprise and disapproval.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t come into a house like this without
knocking at the door,” she said. “If you’ve come
to the meeting you should have knocked at the door
properly and, anyway, the meeting doesn’t begin
till half-past. Have you come to the meeting?”</p>

<p>William hesitated. If he told her that he had come
to catch Ginger’s aunt’s escaped parrot then there
was no doubt at all that Ginger’s aunt would hear
of the escapade from her neighbour and it was of vital
importance to Ginger’s peace of mind and body that
the parrot should be caught and returned to its cage
without Ginger’s aunt having known of its escape.
It seemed better therefore on the whole to have
come to the meeting.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, assuming his blankest expression.</p>

<p>Then another lady very like the first one came in
and stared at William.</p>

<p>“Who is this boy and what’s he doing here?” she
said to the first lady.</p>

<p>“He says he’s come to the meeting,” said the first
lady helplessly.</p>

<p>“But, my <i>dear</i>!” said the second lady, “we don’t
want people like <i>that</i> at the meeting. A rough-looking
boy like <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>The first lady grew yet more helpless.</p>

<p>“But we’ve advertised it as a public meeting,”
she said. “We can’t turn people away, I mean—<i>well</i>,
we <i>can’t</i>. I don’t think it would be legal,” she
ended vaguely.</p>

<p>“But what does he <i>want</i> to come to the meeting
for?” said the second lady. “And a quarter of an
hour too early, too.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s interested in Total Abstinence,”
said the first lady doubtfully. “I suppose there’s no
reason why he shouldn’t be.” She turned to William.
“Are you interested in Total Abstinence?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William without a second’s hesitation
and looking blanker than ever.</p>

<p>Both ladies stared at him and looked very much
perplexed.</p>

<p>Then a man with crossed eyes behind huge horn-rimmed
spectacles and carrying a sheaf of papers
entered and said briskly:</p>

<p>“Is everything ready?”</p>

<p>The first lady pointed to William.</p>

<p>“This boy says he’s interested in Total Abstinence
and wants to come to the meeting,” she said.</p>

<p>William turned a sphinx-like face to the man.</p>

<p>The man subjected William to a lengthy inspection.
William met it unblinkingly. The lengthy inspection
did not seem to reassure the young man at all. He
said reluctantly:</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we can’t turn him out if he wants
to come. I mean we’ve <i>advertised</i> it as a public
meeting——”</p>

<p>“Just what I said,” said the first lady.</p>

<p>“But any monkey tricks from you, my boy——”
said the man threateningly.</p>

<p>“<i>Me!</i>” said William, his sphinx-like look changing
to one of righteous indignation. “<i>Me!</i>” He seemed
hardly able to believe his ears.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the man irritably. “Go and sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
down somewhere at the back. People will be coming
in in a minute.”</p>

<p>William chose a seat just in front of the cabinet
behind which the parrot had taken refuge. The
parrot was preserving a strange silence. William
made violent efforts to see it from his chair till the
second lady said:</p>

<p>“Do sit still there, boy! You make me feel quite
giddy fidgeting about like that.”</p>

<p>So William sat (comparatively) still, wondering how
he could entice the parrot from behind the cabinet and
make his departure with it unobserved. The parrot’s
silence puzzled him. Was it merely resting after the
excitement of its flight or was it planning some outrageous
piece of devilry? People were beginning to
arrive now. They all threw glances at William, curious
and in most cases disapproving. William’s whole
energy was now taken up in meeting their glances with
his blankest stare.</p>

<p>Evidently one lady (who presumably knew him)
was objecting to his presence because he heard the
first lady saying helplessly:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see how we <i>can</i> turn him out. He
said that he wanted to come to the meeting because
he was interested in Total Abstinence ... and he
isn’t <i>doing</i> anything we can turn him out for.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the chair William occupied stood by
itself next to the cabinet. Just in front of him was
the last row of chairs. The chairs were all full now
and the meeting was beginning. He was craning
his neck round to see what had happened to the
parrot. There was still no sound from behind the
cabinet.... He began to think that it must have
gone to sleep....</p>

<p>The cross-eyed man was speaking. “It gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you our speaker, Miss
Rubina Thomasina Fawshaw. Her name is well
known, of course, to all of us——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">“GET OUT, YOU OLD FOOL!” SAID A VOICE. WILLIAM
WAS STARING IN FRONT OF HIM WITH A SET, FIXED
STARE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was at this point that the parrot behind the
cabinet suddenly ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!”</p>

<p>The meeting wheeled round to gaze at William open-mouthed
with horror and indignation. William with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
a great effort
maintained his
sphinx-like expression
and
stared fixedly in
front of him, trying
to look as if he
were in a brown
study and had
not heard the interruption.</p>

<p>The man was
fortunately
rather deaf. After
looking about
him vaguely for
some minutes he
continued. With
a last stern and
threatening
glance at William
the audience
turned round
again to listen.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowe23_125" id="i_237">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_237.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>“ONE MORE INTERRUPTION FROM YOU,
MY BOY,” SAID THE MAN WITH THE
SPECTACLES, “AND OUT YOU GO!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“She is a splendid and well-known worker in this
noble cause. She has for the last six weeks been
travelling in America, and she has there studied the
question of Prohibition in all its aspects——”</p>

<p>“Get out, you old fool!”</p>

<p>They all swung round again. It couldn’t have
come from anyone but William. William was making
a supreme and quite unconvincing attempt to look
innocent. He was staring in front of him with a set,
fixed stare and a purple face. The man with the squint
had heard now. Fixing one furious eye on William
and the other out of the window he said:</p>

<p>“One more such interruption from you, my boy,
and out you go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>The unhappy William made a vague sound in his
throat suggestive of innocence and surprise and
apology and continued to stare fixedly in front of him.
After another short silence the cross-eyed man continued
his speech. The audience, pausing only to throw
final vitriolic glances at William, turned round again
to listen.</p>

<p>“I personally,” went on the cross-eyed man,
“have known Miss Fawshaw for a good many
years——”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking it. It was a vulgar snigger
coming from the back of the room where William
sat.</p>

<p>Without a word the cross-eyed man arose and came
down the room, one baleful eye fixed on William. He
seized his victim by the neck and propelled him before
him out of the room down the hall to the front door,
where he ignominiously ejected him.</p>

<p>Ginger was anxiously awaiting his return.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he greeted him, “you’ve not got it after
all! Whatever’s been happenin’ in there?”</p>

<p>“All sorts of things,” groaned William, rubbing his
neck where the cross-eyed man had held it. “Crumbs!
It was awful. They’re having a meetin’ an’ it kept
sayin’ things an’ they thought it was me. It was
awful! An’ he’s nearly broke my neck.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Ginger anxiously. He meant
the parrot, not William’s neck. He wasn’t interested
in William’s neck.</p>

<p>“It went behind a sort of cupboard place,” said
William, still tenderly caressing his neck, “an’ it was
quite quiet till they started havin’ a meetin’ an’ then
it started sayin’ its things an’ they thought it was
me. Crumbs! It was <i>awful</i>!... It’s right behind
the cupboard thing now. I kept tryin’ to see it but
I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can see it from the window,”
suggested Ginger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>They crept very, very cautiously up to the window.
They could see the parrot quite plainly. It was on
the floor behind the cupboard gazing about it with a
sort of cynical enjoyment. It evidently had not
spoken since it had secured William’s ignominious
ejection. It suddenly saw the Outlaws watching it
through the window and began to walk towards them
across the floor. So intent was the audience upon
Miss Rubina Thomasina Fawshaw’s discourse (she
was giving a lucid account of the effect of alcohol
upon the liver) that no one noticed the parrot walking
sedately across the floor from the cabinet to the
window. Having reached the window it stood for
a few minutes gazing wickedly up at the Outlaws’
faces. Then silently, suddenly it hopped up on
to the open window sill. William put out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Got it!” he breathed.</p>

<p>But he spoke too soon. He hadn’t got it. With
a chuckle it flew off over the fence into the next
garden, leaving William and Ginger gazing after it
despairingly.</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” said William after an eloquent silence.
“We seem sort of <i>doomed</i> with that bird!”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ if we’ve not got it put back by the time
my aunt comes back we’ll be still more doomed,” said
Ginger dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Come on then,” said William, “let’s catch it.
It’s only just sitting on a tree.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” called the parrot, challengingly,
from a small almond tree on which he was perching.</p>

<p>The two Outlaws scaled the fence and very, very
cautiously approached the truant.</p>

<p>“Got him <i>this</i> time,” said William again joyfully
as his outstretched hand descended.</p>

<p>But again he spoke too soon. The parrot squawked
“Get out, you fool,” and slipping nimbly away from
William’s grimy hand flew on to the window sill where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
it hopped up and down excitedly as if executing a
war dance.</p>

<p>“Go on, Ginger,” said William. “Get him! You
can get him there all right!”</p>

<p>Ginger pounced desperately, but the parrot merely
hopped through the open window into the front room
of the house.</p>

<p>“<i>There!</i>” said William, hoarse with horror and
despair, “it’s gone into <i>another</i> house. Well, I’ve
jolly well done enough goin’ into houses after it an’
getting pushed out with someone’s fingers nearly
meetin’ through my neck. You can jolly well go after
it, this time.”</p>

<p>“A’ right,” said Ginger meekly, surveying the room
with some anxiety.</p>

<p>“Go on—it’s all right. It’s empty ’cept for it,”
said William.</p>

<p>The parrot had perched upon an electric light that
hung down from the centre of the ceiling and was
swinging briskly to and fro. Ginger slowly pushed
up the window and slung one leg over the ledge.</p>

<p>Then he looked back at William.</p>

<p>“’S goin’ to be an awful job catchin’ him alone,”
he said pleadingly.</p>

<p>William had been regretting his decision not to
join the expedition. William hated not being in the
thick of an adventure.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “I bet it will take both of us
to catch him.”</p>

<p>And despite his recent ignominious ejection he slung
his leg over the sill after Ginger with quite pleasurable
feelings of zest and excitement.</p>

<p>The parrot had stopped swinging on the electric
light bulb now and was hopping to and fro upon a
polished table. He suggested someone slightly
inebriated trying to perform a very complicated dance.
He probably <i>was</i> slightly inebriated with freedom and
excitement.... The two Outlaws approached him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
With one beady eye fixed on them, but still merrily
performing his dance, he waited again till Ginger’s
outstretched hand was a fraction of an inch from his
back, and then with a diabolical chuckle he flew
straight out of the window again.</p>

<p>“<i>Crumbs!</i>” said William. “Quick! Let’s go after
him or we shan’t know which way he’s gone.”</p>

<p>But just at that minute there came the sound of
the opening of a door and voices approached the room.
Someone was coming.... There wasn’t time to get
out of the window. Already someone was holding
the handle and the voices were just outside the door.
Quick as lightning William and Ginger plunged
beneath the nearest piece of furniture which happened
to be a sofa with—mercifully—a frilled loose cover
that hid them from view. There wasn’t room to
move or breathe but they felt grateful for the temporary
shelter it afforded.</p>

<p>They were in fact so much exercised with the problem
of existence in a space that did not allow for movement
or breathing that at first they did not listen to what
the voices were saying. But having partially solved
the problem of existence in the cramped space and
becoming gradually accustomed to the taste of the
carpet their attention fixed itself upon the conversation
that was going on in the room. Neither Ginger
nor William could see the speakers, but the voices
were those of a girl and a man. The girl was saying:</p>

<p>“Then we’ll do Latham House on Wednesday?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said the man’s voice.</p>

<p>“What time?”</p>

<p>“I suggest three o’clock. Will that do for
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Quite well. You’re <i>sure</i> they’re away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.... We can get the things ready in the
coach-house. All the servants are away too.”</p>

<p>“Good! I hope it will be a success. Frenshams’
was a <i>great</i> success, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>They may have said more, but the Outlaws heard
no more. They were dazed and astounded by the
one stupendous fact. They had found the burglars.
They swallowed several mouthfuls of carpet dust in
sheer ecstasy.... They had found the burglars.
Soon the closing of the door and the silence that
followed it told them that the room was empty, and
they crept out of their hiding-place, tiptoed across
the room and clambered out of the still open
window.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” said William as soon as they were outside.
“The burglars!”</p>

<p>Ginger was no less thrilled than William, but the
parrot still lay upon his conscience.</p>

<p>“The parrot!” he murmured, looking around at
the parrotless expanse of sky and road and garden that
met his gaze.</p>

<p>William looked about too. There was certainly no
sign of the parrot.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind the parrot!” he said contemptuously.
“What’s a <i>parrot</i>?”</p>

<p>Ginger murmured, truly enough, that a parrot is
a parrot, but William stoutly denied it and even
Ginger felt that a parrot paled into complete insignificance
besides a burglar.</p>

<p>“She won’t know it was us,” said William (though
without conviction), “and, anyway, it’s lunch time.
I’m <i>sick</i> of tryin’ to catch parrots. Burglars are
more fun and I bet they’re a jolly sight easier to
catch.”</p>

<p>“What d’you think we’d better do?” said Ginger.
“Go round to Latham House at three o’clock an’
catch ’em?”</p>

<p>But even William’s glorious optimism could not
quite visualise this capture. He frowned for a minute
perplexedly. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Tell you what! We’ll get Robert to come an’
help. He’s mad keen on catchin’ ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“And Hector,” said Ginger.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed William. “Robert an’ Hector.
We’ll tell ’em after dinner—on condition that they let
us help with the catchin’.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Ginger.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>William found that there was no need to lead up
to the question of the burglaries. Robert at lunch
could talk of nothing else. He had decided quite
definitely to capture the burglars. William knew
that this decision was inspired solely by a desire to
attain a heroic standard in the eyes of Miss Julia
Bellairs. Robert wanted to catch the burglar not
for the sake of the adventure but so that Miss Julia
Bellairs might hear that he had caught the burglar.
While despising the motive William appreciated the
decision.</p>

<p>“My theory is,” said Robert importantly, “that
they’ll do our house this afternoon. You see, they’ve
probably discovered that we’re all going to be out
this afternoon. They know that the maids are going
to the fair at Balton and that I’m going out to the
tennis club, and that you and Ethel are going to the
Barlows’ and William’s going to tea to Ginger’s.
They always find out exactly which house is going
to be empty during the afternoon. Now I’ve decided
to pretend to go out to tennis, but I’m going to
come back by the back way and wait in the house
for them. They won’t be expecting me, you see,
and I’ll overpower them before they’ve time to resist
and——”</p>

<p>“How will you overpower them?” said Ethel, quite
unimpressed.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Robert still more importantly, “I
know a very good way to do that. I was reading in
the paper about a man who did it. He knew that a
burglar was coming, so he arranged a pail of water
over the back door, where he knew he’d come in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
because it was the only door not fastened and it fell
down on him and drenched him and took away his
breath, so that the man got him tied up before he
recovered his breath.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t do any such thing, Robert,” said Mrs.
Brown indignantly, “<i>ruining</i> the carpets!”</p>

<p>William took no part in the discussion. William
believed in doing one thing at a time and he was
giving his whole attention to the Irish stew. Moreover,
he realised that Robert must be approached
privately, man to man, on the subject. Women had
such queer ideas. Both his mother and his sister
would, he knew, want to mess up the whole thing by
bringing in the police.</p>

<p>So he followed Robert into the garden after lunch
to impart his information.</p>

<p>“I say, Robert,” he began carelessly. “I know all
about those burglars. They aren’t comin’ here
to-day. They’re goin’ to Latham House. At three
o’clock. I heard ’em say so.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish!” said Robert with elder brother contempt
and severity.</p>

<p>“<i>Honest</i>, Robert!” persisted William. “I’m not
makin’ it up. Honest, I’m not. Ask Ginger. We
heard ’em talkin’ when we was out this morning.”</p>

<p>“Where did you hear them talking?” said
Robert.</p>

<p>William hesitated. To answer that question
accurately would be to reveal the whole parrot episode—an
episode far better left unrevealed. Robert
would have no compunction at all about informing
Ginger’s aunt that it had been Ginger and William
who had let her parrot out. After a slight hesitation
William replied unblushingly:</p>

<p>“Up on the common. On one of the seats.”</p>

<p>He assuaged his conscience (that very amenable
organ) firstly by the consideration that the story in
the main was true and the details were unessential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
and secondly that probably all land was common land
before they built houses on it, so really he wasn’t
telling a story at all.</p>

<p>“What were they saying?” said Robert with
slightly less contempt and severity.</p>

<p>“Well, one of them was a woman and she said,
‘Let’s go an’ burgle Latham House to-morrow,’ an’
they arranged to do that, an’ they said that they
knew that it would be empty an’ they said they’d get
their jemmies and things ready in the coach-house an’
one of them said what a lot of fine things they got out
of Frenshams’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they jolly well did,” commented Robert.
“They got all the silver and a lot of jewellery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they said that,” said William vaguely, “at
least, I <i>think</i> they said that. They said somethin’
like it, anyway. About all the fine things they stole
out of it.”</p>

<p>“What were they like to look at?” said
Robert.</p>

<p>William realised that if he’d heard them talking
on a bench he must have seen them.</p>

<p>“Oh, they looked—they jus’ looked like thieves,”
said William vaguely. “He’d got a beard an’ she’d
got black hair.”</p>

<p>So plainly did William visualise the couple he
described—a Russian communist and a vamp once
seen on the pictures—that he could hardly believe
he hadn’t really seen them.</p>

<p>“She’d got a lot of jewellery on—things she’d stole,
I suppose—an’ he’d got a muffler half-way up his face
an’ a cap pulled down low over his eyes.”</p>

<p>“How did you know he’d got a beard then?” said
Robert.</p>

<p>William was taken aback just for a second, but
quickly recovered himself.</p>

<p>“It was one of those sorts of beards that stretch
right up to the top of the person’s face and then it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
went down underneath his muffler too. It was a big
sort of beard.”</p>

<p>“Did you say Ginger was with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We thought you an’ Hector would like to
catch ’em without troublin’ the police.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the police!” said Robert with a scornful
laugh (Robert had been reading a good many detective
stories lately). “The police aren’t much good at anything
like this. They muddle every case they touch.
But,” rather coldly, “I don’t see why it was necessary
to bring Hector into it. I could have managed it
perfectly well without Hector.”</p>

<p>“Well, nacherally,” retorted William. “Ginger
wanted to have Hector in it same as I wanted to have
you in it. If we thought we could have done it ourselves
we wouldn’t have had either of you in it, but
we thought that probably bein’ bigger than what we
are they’d overpower us before we’d time to catch
’em properly. But, anyway, Ginger heard it same
as I did, an’ he’s as much right to have Hector in it
as I have to have you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Robert stiffly, “I suppose it cannot
be helped now, in any case. I suppose he’ll have
told him.”</p>

<p>A month ago Robert would have delighted in having
Hector to catch the thieves with him. A month ago
Hector had been his bosom friend. But since a
month ago they had both met Miss Julia Bellairs,
and now Hector was no longer his bosom friend but
his rival. They gave each other now only the barest
sign of recognition when meeting in the street, and
when they were both in the presence of the beloved
they affected to be unaware of each other’s existence....
The one drawback in Robert’s eyes to the
present situation was that the glory of catching the
thieves red-handed would have to be shared with
Hector. Still, probably the beloved would understand
that Hector had been merely Watson to his Sherlock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
Holmes. If she did not so understand Robert decided
it should not be for lack of hints.... “A useful
fellow, Hector,” he would say, “of course, I couldn’t
have brought it off without him. I planned the whole
thing, of course, but I couldn’t have pulled it off
without someone to help me.”</p>

<p>“How’re you goin’ to catch ’em?” said William
with interest.</p>

<p>Robert tore himself with an effort from a pleasant
day dream in which Miss Julia Bellairs was saying,
“But how <i>splendid</i>! How <i>wonderful</i>! How <i>brave</i>!...
Weren’t you afraid of being killed?”</p>

<p>And he was replying with a modest laugh: “Well,
you know, I never thought of it. I never do when
there’s any danger.”</p>

<p>“Er—you said three o’clock, didn’t you?” he said
coldly to William.</p>

<p>He wished he’d discovered the thing himself. It
spoilt it somehow to have William and Ginger and
Hector in it....</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William, “an’ they were goin’ to get
their tools ready in the coach-house.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Robert assuming a stern and superior
air, as befitted a master detective, addressing one of
his underlings, “I’ll see Hector and tell him what
to do.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They were all in the coach-house of Latham House.
It was five minutes to three. Robert had fixed
up a very complicated erection—consisting of a lot of
ropes and a pail of water—over the door of the coach-house
in such a way that anyone opening the door
would receive the contents of the pail in full force
upon their head. At least Robert hoped he would.
His band of underlings had proved disappointingly
unaccommodating about that. He had urged them—or
one of them—to go out by the window and enter
by the door in order to see whether the contrivance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
worked and all of them had refused. Robert rather
hoped that Hector would offer. His pride as he gazed
up at the elaborate erection was clouded only by the
thought that no official of Scotland Yard would see it.
He felt that if any official in Scotland Yard were to
see it, they would at once offer him a high salaried
post on the staff. Robert had often thought that he
would make a good detective....</p>

<p>Hector was bitterly resenting the airs that Robert
was putting on over this. He was afraid that Miss
Julia Bellairs would think that Robert’s share in the
capture was more important than it really was. He
was indulging in a day dream in which the beloved
was saying to him: “How <i>wonderful</i>! How <i>brave</i>!
But weren’t you <i>afraid</i>?”</p>

<p>And he was saying nonchalantly:</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Not a bit. I never am, you know. I’d
really as soon have done it without Robert, but the
poor boy was very anxious to help and I didn’t like
to refuse him.”</p>

<p>“It’s nearly three,” said William hopefully.</p>

<p>William was feeling that if he could just live to
see that pail of water overturning on to somebody he
didn’t mind how soon he died after it.</p>

<p>“Quick,” said Robert. “We’d better hide! They
mustn’t see us through the window.”</p>

<p>“Hide quickly,” said Hector in order to prove
to himself that he was giving orders, not taking them
from Robert.</p>

<p>They retired to the shadowy corner of the room—only
just in time. Almost at once two figures were
seen to pass the window walking furtively in single
file. The windows were smeared and dusty, but it
was clear that the figures were those of a man and a
woman. They stopped at the door. Very cautiously
they opened it and entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_249">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>ROBERT, WITH A FLOURISH, REMOVED THE BUCKET.
“JULIA!” HE GASPED.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Robert’s contrivance acted. It acted even more
effectively than he had intended it to act. Not only
did the bucket discharge its contents upon the couple
as they entered. It discharged itself as well, completely
enveloping both of them. The four amateur
Sherlock Holmes’ came out of their hiding-places to
behold the amazing spectacle of two drenched forms—one
a man and the other a woman—sitting back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
back, the upper portion of both their forms completely
enveloped by a tin bucket which had very neatly
caught them both. Muffled screams and shouts came
from beneath the bucket. With admirable presence
of mind Robert darted forward and firmly held down
the extinguisher.</p>

<p>“Get the rope quick, Hector,” he said.</p>

<p>Even as he said it he was mentally composing an
account of the affair for Miss Julia Bellairs.</p>

<p>“At once I held down the bucket quite firmly
despite their struggling and called to Hector to get the
rope for me to tie them up.”</p>

<p>How he wished she were here to see him....</p>

<p>The two were firmly bound together and then
Robert with a flourish removed the extinguisher.</p>

<p>It revealed the bedraggled upper portions of Miss
Julia Bellairs and her cousin.</p>

<p>There followed a scene that baffles description.</p>

<p>William and Ginger crept unostentatiously away
before it had even reached its climax, but before they
departed they had gathered that Miss Julia Bellairs
and her cousin were not burglars, but that they were
engaged in the production of a little souvenir booklet
of the village to be presented to every guest at a
garden party they were giving the next month. The
booklet was to contain a photograph of the house of
every guest but this was to be a surprise—hence the
mystery surrounding the taking of the photographs.</p>

<p>As William said: “With a cracked idea like that
they couldn’t <i>expect</i> anythin’ but trouble.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was that evening.</p>

<p>William and Ginger walked slowly and sadly down
the road.</p>

<p>“Then there’s that parrot,” said Ginger gloomily.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’d been quite forgetting the parrot,” said
William.</p>

<p>“It started it all,” said Ginger yet more gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“I s’pose so,” said William, “but she doesn’t know
you let it out. She’s not been to see your father about
it yet, has she?”</p>

<p>“No, but she might any time—an’ on the top of
the <i>other</i>——”</p>

<p>“Let’s go’n’ see what she’s doin’ about it,” said
William, who never could resist the temptation to
revisit the scene of a crime.</p>

<p>They approached Ginger’s aunt’s house and once
more crept cautiously up to the drawing-room window.</p>

<p>The first sight that met their eyes was the reassuring
one of Ginger’s aunt’s parrot hanging as usual in the
cage and swinging to and fro on his perch.</p>

<p>Further investigation revealed the figure of Ginger’s
aunt and a friend sitting over a tea table.</p>

<p>Their conversation reached the watchers through
the open window.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s a <i>very</i> clever bird,” Ginger’s aunt
was saying proudly. “Why, do you know what he
did this morning? Someone must have left the
window open and he opened his cage door <i>himself</i>
and got out. Right out of the window. I was <i>distracted</i>
when I came home and found him gone. And
then just when I was in the middle of ringing up the
police about it he came back. Simply came in again
through the window and went back into his cage.”</p>

<p>The two Outlaws crept back to the road.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>that’s</i> all right!” said William.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Ginger, “that’s cert’nly <i>one</i> thing
all right.... What’re you goin’ to do now?”</p>

<p>“I’m not quite sure,” said William. “Only,”
very firmly, “I’m not goin’ home jus’ yet. Robert’s
goin’ out at six o’clock an’ I’m not goin’ home till after
that.”</p>

<p>“I’m not either,” said Ginger. “Hector’s goin’
out about then an’ I’m not goin’ home till after that
... you’d think they’d be grateful to us, wouldn’t
you? It made them friends again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Yes, but they aren’t grateful to us,” said William,
“and, of course, it made Robert madder still to find
that the burglars had been to our house while he’d
been out tryin’ to catch ’em at Latham House.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the way they make it all out <i>our</i>
fault——” said Ginger bitterly.</p>

<p>“They always do that,” said William.</p>

<p>“She said she’d never speak to ’em again,” said
Ginger meditatively, “but she said some jolly fine
things to ’em first. Before she said that.”</p>

<p>“So did he,” said William.</p>

<p>With reminiscent appreciative smiles on their
countenances they walked on slowly down the road.</p>
